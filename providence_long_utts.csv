5231,it turned into a giggle and came out ha ha hee
5232,in front of him was a blank wall and huge buffers

5234,the astronaut said up you surprised me when you popped outta the whole like that
5235,we really need your binoculars but I don't know where they are right now
5236,important engines like me should have a panoramic view where I can see people and people can see me
5237,he's that's right he keeps an eye on things
5238,yeah that's what happens when you take the seatbelt off
5239,you were who did the demonstration do you remember
5240,it's a signal it's a crossing gate right
5241,Gordon was happy when it was time to leave

5246,Mommy's got one on and you've got one on

5248,and it probably makes a sound like a warble
5249,you know what people do when they're born babies usually cry when they're born
5250,yeah he has different kind of hands than the other guy
5251,oh no you're right it's just a digger
5252,and the red container's moving all by itself xxx
5253,xxx then when you put this on together with it it's a backhoe

5261,oh all the cookie cutters are over there
5262,set A set A set A set a two set a two set a two set a two
5263,so Oma is gonna bring him back to you

5265,he made the drawbridge go down right on top of Thomas the smokestack
5266,Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies
5267,do you think the pigs would like a sandwich
5268,set a two set a two set a two set a two set a two set a two set a two set a two
5269,maybe he is making a chair that would be a good thing to make
5270,you got too puffed up in your boiler so it serves you right
5271,I don't think it's in there sweetie I saw it downstairs
5272,see this one has little special places to attach it

5277,oh he gets a sticker just like you do and we have some fun xxx stickers
5278,yep you're right two car containers for two cars

5281,busy workers was it busy workers
5282,Spot runs down the steps and rolls on the grass
5283,xxx that's really up and Thomas is really stuck

5286,yeah let's see if we can get this back on
5287,come on Gordon we're going to the new official opening of the station
5288,xxx and dropped him down he was hanging on your finger
5289,that's a funny way to hold the brush
5290,how about the boy with a name just like yours almost
5291,what was the other one you were saying
5292,who's in the picture place squeezed in a tiny space each with a funny face
5293,yeah one is a man and the other one is a woman so she's wearing women's kind of shoes I guess
5294,the driver reduced steam but Gordon was still going too fast
5295,look at all the things on top of it for fighting fires
5296,maybe you could stick the two containers together to make one big container for one car
5297,the turtle can probably take a ride on this
5298,let's try the potty first and then I'll get you your beads
5299,what well they why why did they want him to stop
5300,you wanna put it on the felt board Ethan
5301,well Gordon said Sir Topham Hatt I knew you wanted a panoramic view but this is not the way to achieve it
5302,that's a very good question because we were just using it weren't we
5303,train after train after train after train is falling off the bridge
5304,I'll show you we could scoop up some of those pretty beads
5305,put him gently down on the tracks again
5306,it doesn't work anymore it just creaks and squeaks
5307,because it looks a little bit like a pin+wheel doesn't it
5308,yep when we pull up your pants it'll still be there
5309,when Gordon was repaired again he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening
5310,let's stack it on top yeah and make it twirl
5311,remember when we made the bread the cake we put egg in the cake we cracked the egg
5312,look at all those cars one on top of the other
5313,this time he arrived safely and everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in
5314,that's right mom is a grownup so I can use it
5315,stop painting Mister Noodle how about some blue Mister Ethan
5316,it doesn't really connect does it
5317,oh you mean like the engine in the park was broken because it was sticking up in the air
5318,he liked to do that too he was good at it
5319,it's funny because they're a lot bigger than this rocket+ship aren't they
5320,no his feet are falling off really
5321,let's try to keep the clay on the mat okay
5322,what color do you want for your potty chart
5323,we had one and it broke but I thought we had another one
5324,or pompoms how about he scoops up a bunch of pompoms
5325,that would be very cold and uncomfortable
5326,get your feet out of the way because there's a train coming through
5327,he's pulling the cars right through the tunnel uh oh does the signal say stop or go
5328,you got a lot of paint on your brush there

5343,yeah it does look like the ocean you're right
5344,that was a tough situation when he went into the mine
5345,nothing's inside you can put the egg inside that's a good idea whoops
5346,and I never knew what it meant do you know what it means now Ethan
5347,we don't have the right blocks for mine shaft

5827,rattles and tops and books that won't tear old pots and pans and a fuzzy brown bear
5828,instead of a brown bottom and a green top we need a special magical tree
5829,not in the winter book because there isn't any grass in the winter
5830,and the caterpillar was so hungry he ate through one apple
5831,he even switched the heads on her dolls

5836,maybe we could give it to him for his half birthday because he'll be two and a half too
5837,it's a pickup truck but we have a cover for it
5838,so he ate one piece of chocolate cake one ice+cream cone one pickle one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one piece of watermelon
5839,that's a tomato frog because he's big and red like a tomato

5845,oh you're gonna go down first go down inside and see if you can fit
5846,you can put this on here and make some rocks
5847,I didn't wanna go in the water said Trevor
5848,and he felt much better but he was very chubby then

5863,what happens when you put something in the freezer
5864,Huckle's carrying the garbage can and the vacuum cleaner is sucking it up
5865,it looks like a piece of white clay attached to a piece of black clay
5866,I don't think it's on there but I saw it in the store one day
5867,it's got a spring so his head bounces
5868,police officer Pete's gonna watch everything and make sure you do that right
5869,the cat family gets in the car and drives to town
5870,it's getting smaller so it's almost at the bee isn't it
5871,where's the bunny with the white tail and the long ears
5872,cause when you cut down a tree then you get logs and we have a log on your train table somewhere
5873,that's much that's taller than you are almost
5874,xxx maybe that's like a scarf to keep him warm in the winter when it's cold
5875,at least p+j can't bother me while I'm sleeping said Honey Bunny Funny Bunny
5876,is that good or you want it smaller even
5877,Poppleton's house grew very long icicles in the winter
5878,when Honey Bunny was fast asleep p+j painted her face bright green
5879,so you cut down your tree xxx and a log falls off
5880,yeah no we're gonna leave that there okay
5881,you're right in Poppleton the Pig there were no icicles because it was spring or summer
5882,Mom cried Honey Bunny in the morning look what p+j did
5883,she rolls out the dough and cuts out different shapes
5884,you wanna make some boots that's a good idea
5885,that's a very pretty load and it matches the bed of the truck
5886,you've got yourself a log now load it into the log car
5887,I think we may need to roll it out a little bit more huh
5888,and it has to be cold to have icicles

6004,James is taking a nap on the tracks
6005,of course Olivia's not at all sleepy
6006,mm you could make a little house for them to drive into

6008,it's a very wiggly track isn't it
6009,Honey Bunny was as sad as sad can be
6010,on rainy days she likes to go to the museum and looks at her favorite picture
6011,watch out Thomas James is coming down the track
6012,although she does have a tendency seriously to talk to other people more than she talks to me

6014,xxx the track is kinda crumbled isn't it
6015,oh in the story we read the bee came back

7960,all through the night Mrs Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair

7983,sometimes I have_to keep an eye on her and sometimes I have_to give her dinner
7984,Max said Ruby something's in your underwear drawer that should not be there

8004,when Miffy had tired of her play the Bunny family had a drink of orange juice and then when home for tea
8005,Max knew Ruby would find a reason to throw out his popsicle she might even throw out his quack quack duck
8006,look over there he said to Missus Brown I'm sure I saw a bear
8007,she's in it for like twenty minutes get me out you're stayin in there

8514,Gloria sat down in the back steps and cried
8515,this woman is like married to a cousin of xxx and we went to a baby naming that they were having and
8516,I do not think llamas act quite in that way
8517,one of them was a Molly Kazan book xxx or Molly Katzan the other one who did um
8518,we saw them in New York they have a little boy named Grant remember
8519,oh honey you know what can you put them on the rug
8520,all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran there was an old stone wall
8521,oh I said I'm beginning to feel that your mama must really be a seal
8522,because they're really hard to get off the floor
8523,is your mama a llama I asked my friend Rhonda
8524,let's see if there are any more pirates
8525,so I think it would be better to put them on
8526,why don't you show that funny thing to Jessica honey
8527,I'm in a state of shock and every single one of my friends is pregnant
8528,when she got_to Albert's house he was coming out and carrying a large heavy looking paper bag
8529,in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty family of field mice had their home
8530,I've never seen a skinnier woman in my life
8531,I can't remember the name the moose wood cook books
8532,no she is not is how Rhonda responded
8533,do you remember the names of the other people in the picture
8534,and the baby was maybe two and a half months old or something like that and it was
8535,this have you seen this soap it's kid's soap so that it doesn't slip out of their hands when they use it and it smells like berry
8536,she's got big legs and a pocket for me so I don't think a llama is what she could be
8537,I know it's chilly isn't it
8538,Huckle cat calls his mom to tell her they're on their way home
8539,and due in the next like four months three to five months
8540,I can't said Albert today is my wandering day
8541,did you tell um can you tell Manuela what Swiper says honey
8542,the moose right we like to play with the moose you're right
8543,but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
8544,I swear like I have_to say I do this when my husband is not around she's always like
8545,is your mama a llama I asked my friend Lynne
8546,and it was cute and the drawings were really cute but the recipes
8547,please buy a loaf of bread but don't buy any snacks I have a surprise for you she says
8548,Swiper is this fox on Dora the explorer
8549,oh Lloyd don't be silly Lynne said with a grin
8550,we haven't actually used it yet since she's probably gonna stick it in her eyes and cry but
8551,and since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw
8552,a big bag what do you think is in that bag
8553,and when you see Swiper you have_to say Swiper no swiping but sometimes he steals stuff
8554,um and her sister in law was there and told me she gave birth on Friday night and Sunday was at the pool in her bikini
8555,and these are all people that we're all like close to literally everyone we know
8556,I don't know what the moose says the moose doesn't make that much noise
8557,my mama has big ears long lashes and fur and you of all people should know about her
8558,oh well let's just play with these pirates for now
8559,and they all worked day and night all except Frederick
8560,cling cling cling goes the bell on the fire engine
8561,but if you say Swiper no swiping then he doesn't get to steal it
8562,let me know when you want me to wash your hands okay sweet stuff
8563,I'm like is it fair that she only has mine
8564,there's another engine behind the doors just in case they need help
8565,our mamas belong to the same herd and you know all about llamas because you are one too
8566,it is I think it might be too big for that I'm not sure if it goes with that set ohp nope you've got it
8567,that was that was the picture I just asked her
8568,and so then of course he comes home and she wants his
8569,okay we have_to wait awhile because there are other songs that come first
8570,how do ya get it outta there can you pull the other lever
8571,ooh that's baby Trevor ooh is he's so tiny
8572,he's swimming swimming he's such a good swimmer

8574,oh I love it when you suck and chew on my toothbrush honey
8575,I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days
8576,oh I was gonna say Nordstrom's cafe
8577,xxx the moose doesn't say that much the moose is very quiet the moose doesn't like to talk very much I think
8578,you want mommy to get ooh you got it honey
8579,that's why mommy's have twelve toothbrushes in the passed two months
8580,that's probably a good idea I don't know many people who swim with their shoes on
8581,Huckle and Loly walk passed the garage and the coffee house
8582,Max parked his popsicle where no one would find it
8583,and when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the xxx they said
8584,sweetie pie you want me to lift up your tutu so you don't trip over it
8585,the other day she said something to me like she hit her head or something xxx kiss it so
8586,they said and now Frederick I gather colors answered Frederick simply for winter is gray
8587,I think the Mommy's reading the book about the

8592,and I think the porcupine is very very quiet too
8593,I kiss it and I go is that better no
8594,and once Frederick seemed half asleep are you dreaming Frederick they asked reproachfully but Frederick said oh no I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say
8595,and that is a very tiny is that where we live
8596,if you walk in front you'll be on the camera too
8597,he went out to run an errand with Lily and when he came back and was like I bought you a present
8598,oh gosh he's giving a big plank of wood to the person in the house
8599,and that's that's a pincher too that's lobster
8600,it's so hard to tell the difference between puppy and Floppy sometimes because she'll be like labi you wanna get up here ohp sorry
8601,and then what happens after the baby bunny says he's gonna run away
8602,oh oh hey honey do you feel like going upstairs and getting Polly pockets I think they're

8611,she also does this she will oh you're rocking
8612,when Francis got home Gloria said how did you play so fast that you were home so soon
8613,or is it just the mommy bunny in the book

8621,you're lucky you have a friend to play with said Gloria
8622,I'm trying to tell the difference between chicken the animal and chicken to eat
8623,or she'll walk around but then she come up to either me or Don and grab our legs and push us backwards ta sit us down on a stoop
8624,like you'd actually want to eat them but
8625,in the beginning there was lots to eat and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats and they were a happy family
8626,definitely for older kids because it was not simple photos I mean it would be
8627,I actually haven't listened to it yet
8628,oh when she was younger she used to say moon for the moon
8629,but Max squeezed the rest of the miracle bubbles into his pocket too
8630,oh look and the next day they decided to do something together

8636,Francis and Gloria and their mommy packed them a lunch
8637,did we see the grammas and the grampas
8638,and then she started saying it's you have_to tell by the inflection the difference between moon which sounds like moo and what's the cow saying moo because they sound different but not in terms of like the consonants they only sound different in terms of her intonation
8639,but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone and the corn was only a memory
8640,oh ya you got daddy's tie thanks honey
8641,oh it looks like a piece of pizza you're right
8642,look at the look at the bill on the toucan wow

8678,I could buy the shampoo that Don uses the soap he uses

8706,Max said Ruby your pillow is in your toy chest and your toys are in your bed
8707,hm did we see paintings at the museum

8955,hey Lily did we meet a dog in the doggy park the other day whose name was Daisy
8956,the other day we said to her we were looking at baby pictures of her
8957,is easier to turn if you have two hands
8958,they expressed their ideas creatively through drawing and writing
8959,and she and I said look at this chubby baby I was talking to Donna I wasn't even talking to her though she was sitting in the room though
8960,I know it's hard to get them to stand sometimes isn't it
8961,she would learn about flowers from petal to root how to chew tasty leaves and tunnel through fruit
8962,where the cows grazed and the horses ran
8963,although last coupla days we saw the moon during the day didn't we
8964,not so interested in baby elephant now are we
8965,she drew pictures of Mister Slinger and wrote stories about him too
8966,with an oink and a moo and a quack quack quack the dance is done but we'll be back

8980,when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lilly stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus
8981,ut you did a better job than I did
8982,yeah my parents actually just got back from London
8983,the koala it was my koala when I was lil and his name is Chubby
8984,but she found she lacked talent for hiding in trees for chirping like crickets or humming like bees
8985,she'll walk around and she'll be like this is sticky tape
8986,Lily can you show Manuela how you do the tushie shake and the jump
8987,but the farmer's had moved away

8989,is Jessica a hard word to say do you think
8990,hm where are you going with Manuela's keys honey
8991,she hadn't the strength to drill leaves with her tongue and hardly the stomach for digging in dung
8992,some sort of like opposite polar opposite magnet between the camera and herself
8993,hm I suppose the raisins are coming back out onto the rug again
8994,and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
8995,did you your hands are a lil sticky

8997,do you want to read one of your books

9018,each student was tossed from a leaf of a rose poor little miss spider fell flat on her
9019,she had a new pair of movie star sunglasses
9020,because I know how attached you are to your pockets
9021,right when they were reading the book about the monkeys
9022,you can put them on your doll+house bed if you want
9023,because that actually um we get that on our camcorder
9024,complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's
9025,and my sister's friend sent someone dressed up as Minnie and Mickey Mouse to come and give balloons and sing and everything
9026,no I don't think that would be very good
9027,ooh are you gonna say byebye to the camera honey
9028,she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
9029,it makes everything sound really really fuzzy
9030,the school day was over they sounded the bell she sobbed is there anything I can do well
9031,Boots is Dora's friend so I'm like and she was like look it look it look it
9032,like when we play it back when we have the e i s button
9033,and um my niece who just turned five started crying
9034,we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps
9035,then she heard a bug cry I'm stuck in a spout and she climbed to the top and hoisted him out
9036,and my nephew is like they like sing a song they sing a song and then they said do you want us to sing another song
9037,yeah more in theory than in actuality a lot of time you don't want to watch Roly Poly Oly but he's cute
9038,put on by accident it comes back like static over the whole thing
9039,it's one of these children's books that's written more for adults than kids
9040,we saw a white bust in the museum here right
9041,okay come sit with me lemme put Ben down
9042,sweetie keys only go in the key+hole okay let's not scrape the door

9046,mommy's gonna take your Play_Doh away if you eat it
9047,he has a book what's he doing with the book
9048,oh the song didn't Mickey and Minnie sing songs when they were over

9053,there is dirt in there we don't wanna play with that
9054,our gifts they are many we hop fly and crawl but kindness he said is the finest of all
9055,Lilly really really wanted to show everyone
9056,he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself
9057,Tigger can bounce over one shiny watering can and two ripe tomatoes
9058,and in fact that dirt's two and a half years old because Daddy and I have never used the fireplace
9059,are you gonna help me read it
9060,staring at the meadow they said and now Fredrick
9061,and you love um you love strongly flavored cheese
9062,he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture
9063,the glasses were so glittery the quarters were so shiny and the purse played such nice music not to mention how excellent it was for xxx storing school supplies
9064,I swear I don't know where she gets this stuff from
9065,which rested in the dark corners of the storage room
9066,look she whispered look everyone look what I've got
9067,I think the girl might actually be in your crib
9068,she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think
9069,I know you don't like to have your nose wiped
9070,a bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck

9076,yeah she won't eat tuna in water she'll only eat packed in olive oil with salt in it
9077,a hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap
9078,Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard
9079,and where's your coffee oh here's the coffee mug
9080,oop oop oop oop we don't want everything to fall out of Manuela's bag

9094,he ate a bouncing ball that belonged to uncle Benny's dog Buster
9095,she thought and thought and thought and then she became angry
9096,it's so funny that she's so cautious in some ways
9097,and who's sitter's name is Rosie
9098,she thought and thought and thought some more and then she became furious and drew a picture of Mister Slinger
9099,Buster is no bargain he barks all the time
9100,I'll get the box and put some train tracks away
9101,she won't go she'll stand at the top of the stairs Mommy never tries to go down them

9106,oh look and the rug is on mommy's pants lovely
9107,actually the helmet was Norman's home
9108,Roo's wearing a blue shirt and blowing bubbles
9109,right before the last bell rang she sneaked the drawing into Mister Slinger's book bag
9110,which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio
9111,well papa Jay lives with grandma Rosie but who on tv has a sister Rosie
9112,xxx the rug was shedding see I have rug fur all over me
9113,do you think we should come up with a name for him
9114,just a lil bit they're so green and scary
9115,the night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind
9116,just see what a splendid sky light the visor made
9117,that's not the thing that goes on all night long
9118,let's see what if his name was what's a good name for a mouse
9119,who do you watch on tv that you like that has a little sister named Rosie
9120,let me just watch this off just a lil bit
9121,like museum tours or something when you walk around with a little microphone
9122,you've got a bag too and they're both purple
9123,and here's my best friend Doreen Parsley the great dancer
9124,each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful
9125,out came the sun and dried up all the rain
9126,this poor tea set we don't know where anything is
9127,perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue
9128,his mother called him wild thing and Max said I'll eat you up
9129,and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again
9130,do you think we should go later and get you a new tea set
9131,one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire
9132,so he was sent to bed without eating anything
9133,you're going to go up and sit next to Manuela
9134,your tummy is gonna hurt if you eat that
9135,oh Lilly was very sad and ran all the way home
9136,I hope it's warmer where she is
9137,she found a nice note from Mister Slinger and some snacks in her bag and she felt very guilty
9138,that very night in Max's room a forest grew
9139,you need a new tea pot because we can't find your old one
9140,while Doreen and I were making egg salad sandwiches for the egg head club
9141,a king oh my gosh honey that is a king I didn't even know you had knew that word
9142,and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and his walls became the world all around
9143,she doesn't like the music particularly she likes this lil
9144,so her mother wrote a note and her father made some delicious snacks
9145,yeah it's a show that I mean she she's only been watching it maybe for a couple of weeks it's on in the morning and she doesn't I let her watch tv when I take a shower and um
9146,it's like the toy itself is not so interesting it's just the fact that there's water there you know
9147,okay lemme put this back on and then Mommy will go get you some olives okay
9148,and we can tell uncle Steve that there is a mouse named after him
9149,and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right
9150,and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day
9151,oh you wanna come up here and look at the crane
9152,that can't possibly taste good I really just don't believe it taste good
9153,you're going to get Sleeping Beauty to put in the house
9154,these are for you she said to Mister Slinger because I'm really really really really really really really really really really really really sorry
9155,although it's probably hiding somewhere around here
9156,xxx I'm giving you the tickie you're right
9157,winter days came and when the first snow fell the five lil field mice took to their hide out in the stones
9158,let's see you were playing with one with Gabby yesterday right

9161,djou wanna get your you wanna bring your mixer in here honey and show your mixer to Manuela
9162,all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes
9163,and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are
9164,really really really really really really really sorry
9165,she doesn't like starch she really doesn't like french fries
9166,she'll still blow kisses but she'll take especially with Floppy and the puppy she'll just walk it around and mm
9167,you know what you didn't say to Manuela honey
9168,oh my gosh Lily look who I found under the couch
9169,Fez is also a city in a country in Morocco
9170,okay let's eat the rest of our black olives should we show Manuela how we put them on
9171,until at last he created something he was really proud of
9172,Mister Slinger read the story and looked at the picture and sampled the snacks
9173,we got a lot of snow a lil while ago
9174,and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and they gnashed their terrible teeth and they rolled their terrible eyes and they showed their terrible claws
9175,it's not like it doesn't have water in it
9176,well why don't we play with the house first and then mommy will fix the train tracks
9177,it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze
9178,because they're not brown like the other ones or black
9179,buy Caillou is really cute because it's a little boy with his lil sister who's a baby
9180,there's no water in there do you wanna pour the water in
9181,do you want to play with your sticker book
9182,oop those are Manuela's we don't wanna touch those
9183,a lot of times if she sees any big signs or something that xxx a lot of letters she'll sit there and go a p a b a c an o an m
9184,xxx you have a lot of raisins in your mouth little girl
9185,that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse
9186,she's probably like a year old and I guess he's supposed to be three or something but it's really sweet because all the stuff they do is you know being at the play+ground and the slide because it's too big or he's frustrated at something so he keeps throwing things or he tries to take care of Rosie by himself and um it's all very actually very appropriate situations because it's everything that goes on with her
9187,okay you don't wanna put the black ones on your fingers
9188,do you want me to get your paper to give to Manuela
9189,early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway
9190,in the beginning there was lots to eat
9191,he's wearing a shirt what's on his shirt
9192,maybe Belle wants to take a nap on that lil red bed
9193,and the mouses told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats
9194,oh you're bringing Polly pocket's clothes to Manuela
9195,like she doesn't even know what the letters are
9196,right the truck xxx the the truck xxx took down the tree right
9197,you know what honey Mommy's very tired because someone got up at four in the morning
9198,and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once
9199,oh no you can't draw on the block sweetie only on the paper
9200,while the twinkle twins were gluing together Mooky's halloween costume
9201,my_goodness I didn't know this much stuff could fit under a couch
9202,Polly likes to put her head under the water
9203,you did a great job you put your backpack right back on
9204,and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all
9205,normally we don't take down trees but that tree wasn't
9206,then she did a little performance using her bag and glasses and props
9207,why can't I show my wire statue he said
9208,I have no idea who's keys these are
9209,my gosh what's mommy's measuring cup doing under the couch
9210,the other bed for Cinderella is in the box I think
9211,the tree was sick and it might fall on someone so they had to take it down before it fell
9212,I mean I don't really know how much she's taking in at this point but
9213,and a a boot I know we don't know where the other boot is
9214,oh you're gonna dry her off thanks honey
9215,all pieces must have a title he well knew
9216,do you wanna draw a little tiny circle for Manuela
9217,three loving kisses on the cheeks and nose
9218,she was playing with the clothes yesterday she was like I love clothes
9219,oh too tight a squeeze honey no no no no too tight
9220,two strong arms around a fuzzy bear's head
9221,we have two P_B_S channels it's on twenty one
9222,stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese from the word cheese he pasted them together
9223,why don't you go show Manuela what you have_to eat
9224,she looked at them often but did not disturb a soul
9225,did you know Mommy and Daddy used to have a tree outside our house
9226,I don't I don't know that we took any pictures
9227,what's that big thing you when you throw it up and you run under it
9228,I have no idea I mean the Caillou the way they spell it's gotta be a french name I mean it's c a i l l o u
9229,when I turned my back for an itsy iota of time
9230,she ran and skipped and hopped and flew all the way home
9231,yeah and like you know about the whole Master_Card visa thing she's yeah
9232,now he had a fitting title for his wire work
9233,that's a vest just like the bunny was wearing
9234,no that's too heavy honey I don't want that to fall on your toe it's too heavy
9235,although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat
9236,it's the funniest thing she only looks at the map upside down
9237,that was the most pitiful thing she just went inside and she said mommy I sorry
9238,and that's a nest with the little eggs in it
9239,that is when she didn't want to be a dancer or a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva
9240,can you remember what Fredrick said about sun rays
9241,then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces
9242,and now cried Max let the wild rumpus begin
9243,but I don't I have no idea I mean I don't know maybe it was a french show and they made it into to ya know
9244,you're drinking Lily's water and Mommy's water
9245,I don't want you to fall on your tushie
9246,it's empty would you like to throw it away
9247,I've created a monster yeah I know right oh my god
9248,oh she was sleeping on the floor yesterday right
9249,she has a bag and she's in the bathtub that's kind of silly
9250,there the mouse is hiding there under the cover
9251,yeah robin's eggs are in the nest bird's eggs
9252,were you playing with Elmo in the backyard the other day
9253,what is inside is a secret but I will tell only you
9254,Olivia is very good at wearing people out
9255,we can't tell if she's left or right handed
9256,she was pretending to sleep on the floor
9257,now stop Max said and sent the wild things to bed without their supper
9258,what do you think Snow White has to do today
9259,and then he told them of the blue periwinkles
9260,I'd like to apply for another credit card because twelve is not enough
9261,at the lucky dog show he ate all the leashes
9262,once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another
9263,that lil Elmo sprinkler what's he holding in his hand
9264,and Max the king of all wild things was lonely
9265,sometimes Ian just won't leave Olivia alone and she has to be firm
9266,but like she does big circles with her right hand but she does little circles with her left hand
9267,it's so funny because a lot of things that she says I don't
9268,was the microphone looking at the dirt honey
9269,hm does Trevor live with Phoebe can you say Trevor
9270,and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all
9271,he still had to be extremely careful of the guard
9272,um because like a the bathing suit like a maillot right that's what they call it has a double l
9273,so why don't you tell Manuela about Michael's doing in the kitchen honey
9274,if you get lost a policeman can help you find your way
9275,sweetie sweetie mommy's doing it you don't have_to cry
9276,they saw the colors as clearly as they saw as if they had been painted in their minds
9277,and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat
9278,it's the type of thing where she'll say them and then it's like a couple seconds afterward it's like oh
9279,let Mommy get the phone for one sec sweet stuff
9280,um I don't necessarily know if she knows exactly what it means because
9281,do you remember where aunt Jill and uncle Steve and Matthew live
9282,um he's a lil boy it's just a lil yeah they're just kids
9283,oh she's still got her flip+flops on oh that's great for the water
9284,hm I don't know I don't see another boot in here but I'm sure it's here somewhere
9285,so he gave up being king of where the wild things are
9286,if I could put on a suit of scales
9287,does Snow White like to have a cup of coffee every now and again
9288,I don't wanna make a mountain out of a mole hill
9289,police officers make sure that people drive safe right
9290,Lily what's the funny way you say gramma Rosie's name
9291,okay you wanna put the green dress on instead
9292,a lot of times like if we once I said to her we were gonna go to the children's museum and we drove there and it wasn't open
9293,but the wild things cried oh please don't go we'll eat you up we love you so
9294,we'll have_to look around for it it probably fell out
9295,I know believe it or not there's actually a show with humans in it
9296,did mom did a police officer give mommy a ticket
9297,I'd close my eyes and then I'd wish
9298,we haven't found Percy we'll have_to keep looking
9299,no that's just that's they live in just they live in Virginia
9300,and a lot of times she'll say something to me and I don't know what she's saying and I just need to like not even put it in context and just keep repeating the word
9301,where does Snow White what's the name of the coffee store that Snow White goes
9302,whoa that's a lil too much spilling okay lil too much splashing I think honey honey
9303,now Benny has no money to buy Buster a new ball
9304,that's the one that grows the peaches and the peanuts remember
9305,you want my to put the green dress on instead
9306,the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws
9307,and I kept saying oh gosh it's closed I'm sorry I'm sorry so it in some ways she says it sometimes and I think that she just means like um
9308,which you will remember Pete ate many letters ago
9309,yeah there used to be a big tree now there's a big
9310,mommy wasn't really going that fast though
9311,I'd flip down rivers and splash in the sea I'd swim so far you'd never catch me
9312,do you remember what this one is next to Georgia
9313,when Stephanie was here she was like kept sayin dede to things
9314,that big stick is called the trunk of the tree
9315,she looks like she's having a good time
9316,sweetie we don't want the whole thing to spill all over right
9317,do you want to do it or do you want Mommy to do it
9318,but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye
9319,oh a box that's a big box thanks angel
9320,then I'm at the opinion that this dog is okay
9321,do you remember the name of the coffee store we go to with Tamar
9322,and there's a statue of a man riding a horse
9323,I got you roast beef because you love roast beef
9324,like Stephanie Stephanie's gonna get the tape she's gonna get the tape what how was I supposed to know that
9325,do you want me to draw a little picture for you
9326,Mississippi oh my gosh I didn't even know you knew that one
9327,and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day
9328,and a statue of a lil boy and girl holding a balloon
9329,sometimes we say I'm sorry kind of like that's a shame right
9330,and she said take that Pete back to the pet shop
9331,and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him
9332,one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers
9333,after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work
9334,doctor's help people stay healthy by giving them regular check ups
9335,we usually get one pot of water a day to spill as we like
9336,then comes in the summer who paints in the flowers

9343,you wanna blow you wanna give a kiss to the camera
9344,oh thank you know what that's a dirty one mommy'll get a clean one
9345,I don't think she's in the proper age group for them but of course her cousin Phoebe has them so like
9346,would you love a dog who ate your lucky quarter
9347,remember we went to the children's museum and it was closed
9348,you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do
9349,aren't we lucky the seasons are four
9350,actually they make the funniest connections because all the Maisy books if she finds one in there have um stripes sort of around the sides of the covers
9351,you know where Olivia is wearing her bathing suit
9352,okay why don't you bring your magazine over to mommy
9353,Montana looks a lil more like a rectangle but it's a funny shape

9392,there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny
9393,I think it's sand but it looks like a pile of dirt
9394,I'm like I'm never eating anything in this house again until this kitchen is done
9395,yes but remember the contest is open to great and small
9396,it's a little worrisome when you're you know not even two years old yet I wanna look like Polly pockets too
9397,it doesn't look like your mom does it
9398,then I will become a fisherman said his mother and fish for you
9399,I was trying to think if uh there's there used to be an International House of Pancakes in Cranston
9400,one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I
9401,because you know there's paper plates and if you heat anything in the microwave in a paper plate you have_to bring in
9402,Twinkie looks like she's got like sticks coming out of her fur
9403,hang on Mommy'll put the moon song on hang on

9408,let's see what we have here oh the Count is reading a book
9409,like a plastic thing you have to bring it up to the bathroom to wash it because we don't have water downstairs
9410,the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist
9411,oh let's see where is the duckie book
9412,if you become a fisherman said the little bunny I will become a rock on the mountain
9413,but next to Matthew she must look like a real midget
9414,I know it's kinda hard to tell the d the p and the b all look sort of similar but that's a d d for duck
9415,but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped
9416,you can understand I would be unhappy to say this but
9417,that was at the native american powwow in Bristol
9418,it's hot today Maisy's having a nice cold drink mm lemonade
9419,ah I think that's the Mommy actually honey she's going to look for her babies over here
9420,there are very very few restaurants that are like
9421,so this is where my mouse traps have been going
9422,it's the man with the big hat you're right
9423,why don't you tell Manuela who's in your basket
9424,pilots fly airplanes and helicopters up up up into the sky
9425,I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher
9426,ooh look at this book we haven't read this in a long time
9427,a friend of mine was saying that they um
9428,a two year old a five year old and a seven year old to
9429,that's the color that's the same color as the robot
9430,what does she can you tell at all who she looks like
9431,and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement
9432,Eddy's hot too so Maisy shares her lemonade
9433,it's snowing said the boy with the dog
9434,okay let's read the Pooh book and we'll also read the mouse book
9435,who's in daycare now and they're having another baby
9436,what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet
9437,so they're looking to have someone come to work in their house

9439,it's all gone poor Eddy he's very thirsty
9440,have you seen her lil you've seen her eyes right when she makes that eye thing
9441,see when Matthew was born you must have been like that's my kid

9443,oh that's true we could definitely do that

9445,should we read the Pooh xxx Pooh book first or the mouse book
9446,that was great you wanna play your harmonica
9447,there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps
9448,they think it would be cheaper if not the same price
9449,you know the states aren't always the same color on different
9450,and now you're like who's this dark haired baby
9451,then I will become a crocus in a hidden garden
9452,some pilots fly small planes with propellers in the front
9453,she picks some fruit with a little help from Eddy
9454,in his wallet Rocky keeps a list of all the times he was insulted in his whole life
9455,and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse
9456,in the kitchen Eddy squeezes lemon juice into a pitcher
9457,on different maps the states may be different colors honey
9458,whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard
9459,and like I think I'm gonna have_to get some more toys at home
9460,Polly pocket I know I don't know where the other one is
9461,air traffic controllers tell pilots when their planes can take off
9462,then Eddy stirs in some sugar there a fresh pitcher of delicious lemonade
9463,this is what we do every night at dinner because of her place mat
9464,is she with you guys or is she in the nursery already
9465,during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman
9466,and big jet airplanes carry people mail and many other things
9467,Maisy goes to get the cups slurp what's that noise
9468,when Pete eats extra crunchy extra cheesy cheese doodles
9469,a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting
9470,but as soon as one melts another takes its place
9471,it's Eddy he couldn't wait but there's plenty for Maisy too good job
9472,when we we uh Lily got up this morning I'm like ant Jill is at the hospital she's having baby Cassey

9475,and you're gonna put them in the bag
9476,ah is the oven already I thought I put the oven in the house already
9477,and he was getting mighty cold and hungry
9478,sweetie what else did you have_to eat last night with your lemons
9479,though I don't know if you remember all of them
9480,but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard
9481,you know soon I think we'll take an airplane down to visit aunt Jill and uncle Steve when aunt Jill has her new baby
9482,New Hampshire and do you remember what's next to New Hampshire
9483,um I know I have a plug in here somewhere because I have a lamp plugged in over there
9484,Tigger can bounce over one shiny watering can
9485,there you are said the guard as Norman fled inside
9486,so what time did they actually start the c_section
9487,but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it
9488,no shirts on they had shirts we took them off
9489,read the book first and then I'll get baby elephant
9490,two elbows two elbows bum bum bum bum bum bum
9491,and the yoyos of the twinkle twins and now there will be no yoyo contest
9492,he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff
9493,mommy's gonna pull your yoink pants up
9494,no we have_to keep it on while Manuela is here so they can record you
9495,maybe you can find a letter that you know or something like that
9496,why don't you tell Manuela what you do like to watch on tv
9497,and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail
9498,but snowflakes don't listen to radio and they don't watch television
9499,see Tigger bounce past seven straw baskets and eight flapping shirts
9500,yeah huh where's the bear oh help Elmo find his missing teddy+bear
9501,she was sitting in her high chair and then she said she wanted to sit next to me so I put her in the booth next to me and she stood up and she stood up and I was like Lily you better sit down and she wah fell right down
9502,sweetie would you like a lil how about mommy gets you a piece of chocolate pop tart
9503,are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard
9504,maybe we should learn a different one that one seems to be hard to say for you
9505,circling and swirling spinning and twirling dancing and playing here and there
9506,when fire fighters hear the alarm they have_to move quickly
9507,and you can stick it like to the car or something
9508,oh my God I can't believe you're gonna have a super blonde blue eyed baby and then a dark eyed dark haired baby
9509,fire fighters help people get out of burning buildings safely

9515,Norman was sure he was being taken to jail
9516,sighed Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg
9517,and the fire fighter fastens her hose to the fire hydrant
9518,she actually when she was gosh maybe hi sweetie
9519,and the mother goose is wearing boots too
9520,you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze
9521,is this called the best word book ever
9522,I'm tired and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg
9523,while the pumper truck pumps the water from the hydrant through the hose
9524,when she was I don't know fourteen fifteen months or something like that
9525,I will be the wind and blow you where I want you to go
9526,and didjou see what kind of cake didjou see when we left you saw snowman cake and what other kind of cake

9533,my parents have this little thing called the golem
9534,and we'd say to her can you do those eyes
9535,and the fire fighters slide down the pole and into their gear
9536,who's the guy with the big red suit and the red hat and the beard
9537,the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly
9538,which is like this old folk tale or something like that
9539,people have told me about that you know people who are cross country following the wiggles I mean
9540,floating floating through the air falling falling everywhere
9541,here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow

9543,we were at a party actually the neighbors house the other night it was just all adults and her and my other neighbor was like Lily can you do those eyes and she did it and everyone was like woo
9544,then I will join the circus and fly away on a flying trapeze

9553,you can put the piano down on the rug if that's easier
9554,hello said the lazy bird smiling her best

9556,and who usually what kind of bird lives with the giraffes at the zoo
9557,for the entire country to see what I'm feeding you at nine thirty in the mourning
9558,so I think apple man is being condensed into something like apman
9559,you're right Horton's got a tail too

9566,Dandelion woke up stretched and yawned and jumped out of bed
9567,right Horton's tail is white and Mazy's is red
9568,maybe that's where they make your smoked gouda cheese
9569,with the black feathers and the white feathers on the tushie

9620,oh I see are you going to pick that red ripe strawberry

9637,and we've had to start spelling things certain things
9638,she was running around the room on a Saturday morning and we're like oh so tired
9639,the big hungry bear can smell a red ripe strawberry a mile away
9640,should we finish Horton or should I put him away

9659,we got them each a lollipop and they sat on the chair like this
9660,don't be afraid my little moon beam said Felix's mama but Felix was afraid

9664,I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
9665,he plows the fields and plants the crops
9666,though sometimes after Gymboree we go and get a lollie for you to
9667,Felix was afraid the doctor would ask his mama to leave the room where's Felix
9668,this is Lily's favorite thing about the book the dress
9669,they looked like they were totally drugged out
9670,and I'm like okay honey that's a little nun like I didn't understand what she was saying
9671,do you guys have um oh do your not even in the room yet are you
9672,she points out all the girls wedding dresses
9673,I put Lily in an armchair and she was laying sideways with her head over one of the arms and her legs over the other one
9674,well I wouldn't like a dirty diaper either
9675,do you remember what this big whole thing is up here
9676,but now Dandelion thought he really should wear something more elegant than a sweater to the party
9677,but doctor duck did not ask Felix's mama to leave the room doctor duck let Felix's mama stay with him the whole time
9678,I was gonna say let me take your number so I can call you later
9679,so she kept saying that's a little nun Mommy that's a little nun
9680,oh gosh I don't think it fits in there
9681,mail carriers deliver letters and packages to people's homes
9682,but I'm sure you can do it no trouble at all
9683,this jacket is the very newest style said Theodore the tailor
9684,doctor duck listened to Felix's heart and looked into Felix's ears and took his temperature
9685,and I turn around and she's got a dreidel and she's pointing to one of the Hebrew letters which hello xxx and I don't even know
9686,the xxx strawberry and the mouse are wearing glasses too that is so silly
9687,you don't want to read bread and jam for Francis

9689,I thought you weren't allowed to use cell phones in the

9691,then he gave Felix two spoonfuls of happy tummy and said call me in the morning
9692,sweetie pie did you wanna go get a book to read
9693,quick there's only one way in the whole wide world to save a red ripe strawberry from a hungry bear
9694,her new thing is to climb on the couch and stand on one corner and throw herself down on to the other end
9695,don't you worry sweetie Mommy'll get you a new book
9696,he didn't wake up until he smelled butter toast and lemon tea

9836,because it took so long to get your sweater off
9837,well girls have tushies and girls also have a vagina
9838,the only problem is Lily gave me this wonderful cold and the more I read to her the more I start coughing
9839,we're gonna go next week to see baby Cassey
9840,Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
9841,apparently like the best one or one of the best ones is Dora the explorer
9842,his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
9843,suddenly they turned a corner and found himself in what seemed like a different world
9844,she said like she still comes up with things sometimes and Don and I can't believe
9845,she's so obsessed with like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and everything
9846,a pink blankie we have lots_of presents for baby Cassey

9880,we have_to wait a little bit because the apple chips are coming all the way from New York
9881,and Jennifer Giraffe told Dandelion about the silly looking lion that had come to the door
9882,you know where we keep your books in your room

9905,and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl

10276,and a crayon and I will show you how to write it

10289,by the time Cinderella finished her chores she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball and she was very sad
10290,you know what you are you're hysterically funny
10291,soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door
10292,everyone was very excited and by the time they set out the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move

10316,do big girls use underpants and use the potty
10317,and um they are yummy the sweet and sour ones have dried pineapple in them
10318,Cinderella ran to the garden and wept just then sparkling lights swirled all around her it was her fairy godmother
10319,is there a kitty cat who likes to play with the mouse
10320,Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear
10321,right very tall and very small or very high and very low
10322,um a mole is like um it's not a bird he lives underground he tunnels around and eats dirt I think

10329,want me to put it back on and you can take it off
10330,well if you guys decide not to go although I think it'll still be fun but if you decide not to go make a reservation now for the spring or something
10331,and it took us a long time but not as long as it took Nancy
10332,Mister Brown was right it was a long journey
10333,with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a
10334,okay we have_to be very careful with the wire not to break it
10335,the yellow container's behind you sweetie can you get that
10336,as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto a stool to look out the window
10337,but when they reached the seaside the sight of the land and water soon made up for it
10338,actually Nancy probably went the other way around
10339,right and when you're a big girl you're going to wear underpants all the time right and not diapers the candle holders
10340,Zoe's shirt has circles and stars on it

10342,here why don't you come over here mommy will fix it
10343,look behind you on the floor at how many bubbles there are
10344,Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car
10345,the yellow container can you put the yellow container over here
10346,but you're doing such a good job of it
10347,a coach and yyy Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown

10349,when we go outdoors we see what the weather is like

10357,before she left the ball she received a warning though on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken the fairy godmother told her and everything will be as before
10358,baby Ariel says let's talk like big girls

10376,does he go like this and then if he wants just one instrument does he go like this
10377,swinging down from a thread she hung on by one leg
10378,I must go she cried but as she fled she lost a glass slipper on the staircase
10379,when djou used to sit on the boppie when you were a teeny tiny baby
10380,he couldn't even see to turn the taps off
10381,she xxx I just taught her seagulls this morning and we were driving back from my sister's um when she was at work
10382,Mr and Mrs Mouse took the children to the zoo
10383,watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover
10384,Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so it's not to disturb anyone and then much louder
10385,I don't think Mommy has any Clifford juice sweetie we'll have_to buy some
10386,the next day the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper
10387,what are some of the things that you can do to help around your house
10388,she dangled there wondering where is my mother
10389,yeah but see if you get it she'll follow you in
10390,how will those children ever get those children into their house tonight
10391,well we can't really put juice in here honey because this is for candles not for liquids
10392,did she squeeze down a hole or dive under water
10393,look sweetie I'll show you how to use the boppie look
10394,when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite she locked Cinderella in her room
10395,Lily said seagulls seagulls and there's like a
10396,why won't she come out here and meet her new daughter
10397,you sit up and then the boppie goes around your waist like that
10398,she climbed to the tippy top of a tree
10399,like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it
10400,oh honey lemme go look I don't think I have any but do you want Mommy to look
10401,he took off his hat and began to use it to bail out the water
10402,let me out Cinderella cried the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden who's foot fit the tiny glass shoe
10403,gazing out on the world she sobbed where can mom be
10404,we can give her her necklace back when she gets back
10405,you're right gramma Rosie got baby Ariel for you
10406,I think there's a Polly in your ultra oo whoopsie
10407,a beetle named Betty buzzed by this high perch
10408,that's a lot are those puppy treats for Daisy
10409,downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington
10410,Cinderella's little friends took the key out of the stepmother's pocket and slipped it under the door to Cinderella
10411,a child needs a mother may I please help you search
10412,Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things
10413,you know what honey gramma Rosie got you blankie to
10414,looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling
10415,oh it's a candle holder oh I see
10416,you can give the necklace then because who are we going to see tomorrow
10417,I hope the air doesn't get used up Missus Brown he said in a loud voice
10418,when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot it fit perfectly
10419,I told you this story right when she was
10420,soon after Cinderella and the prince were married and they lived happily ever after
10421,and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed
10422,yeah I don't know for but she doesn't know that
10423,if they just sold a roll of stickers like a hundred feet long
10424,oh you know honey if you can go find me a piece of money mommy will you get you a jelly bean
10425,Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor
10426,I don't know for sure but I'll offer this clue if I were your mother I'd be looking for you
10427,come on Paddington called Judy let's go for a swim
10428,long ago there lived a lovely princess named Snow White
10429,Raffi's a singer a children's singer and that's the name of the song baby Beluga
10430,Clifford are we going to go see Clifford tomorrow
10431,that was very fun they were swimming
10432,her stepmother the queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty
10433,um I came downstairs and she had a paintbrush and was painting Desitin all over the kitchen floor
10434,he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances and by the time he went into the sea he was wearing so many things he promptly sank
10435,well the problem is finding the right ones
10436,they flew through the trees spying down from the sky
10437,did you see our pink flowers are all opening
10438,oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you
10439,can you say hi and Jessica will know it's for her
10440,so Phoebe had said something to Ellen my sister in law xxx what didjou just say xxx she like didn't want to tell her
10441,each day the queen would ask magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all
10442,but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone
10443,that was Al he's coming to replace the batteries for the alarm
10444,yeah that's why mommy clips her's to her shirt because it's right near my mouth
10445,look on the floor see if you see any money on the floor
10446,no wonder cried Judy you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands
10447,and I went downstairs and I was like oh honey what are you doing and she goes
10448,we were in the toy store yesterday actually
10449,what did we see the last time we were there
10450,and um they had rolls of stickers but they were like you know of nothing interesting you know what I mean
10451,she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig
10452,one day the mirror said a lovely maid I see who is more fair than thee
10453,fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water exclaimed Jonathan
10454,hey Lily didjou tell why don't you tell Manuela where we went with Nancy and Louana the other day
10455,have you seen my mom she's like me only big
10456,Paddington sat up and said what good luck I had my hat
10457,I thought the water might be cold said Paddington
10458,dada because that's what Lily always says when she like just doesn't want
10459,it would have_to be of something that she would actually
10460,are you gonna get a big girl bed one day
10461,and what about what was the black bear called
10462,do you think we when we go to New York we should tell gramma Rosie to get yogurt for you
10463,let's see what else do we see in the house
10464,Snow White was so beautiful and kind that even a handsome prince who was passing by noticed her
10465,we went to see the butterfly exhibit at the Roger Williams park
10466,after his paw bands had been properly blown up Paddington went in the water again
10467,sometime later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs
10468,xxx she doesn't know but also when she just doesn't wanna you know right
10469,we just bought her bedding for her bed that is nonexistent that she will never go in
10470,we have_to clean that window there's bird poop on the window
10471,like if you give her a whole roll of the alphabet stickers she'd be like whatever
10472,settling himself down in a small arm chair by the fire
10473,up there is a mother who's yellow and black
10474,and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed
10475,little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow White the queen was watching
10476,I keep saying to her I'm like gonna have a big girl bed one day no
10477,he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes
10478,with a heart full of joy she peered over the straw
10479,mommy just has to go wipe her hand off because I got something mooshy on it
10480,but it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw
10481,Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him
10482,Snow White realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen she was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest
10483,it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried
10484,he had a feeling that life with the Brown's was going to be
10485,yeah really we're having a down day
10486,your dinner is here darlings so open up wide
10487,Lily is very obsessed with dresses these days
10488,we might be able to see some of mommy's friends when we go in
10489,then there were the sound of people booing
10490,and we have_to go with friends of mine to look at they just sold their house and they're looking at houses today
10491,do you know where I can stay she asked a group of friendly animals
10492,do you wanna Lily can you draw a picture of maybe you wanna draw a picture of Dora
10493,they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy explained Missus Brown

10497,that is that's a lake actually that's lake Michigan
10498,she'll be a real charmer won't she
10499,jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears
10500,she was whisked out of sight and Brave_Bittle Brave_Beetle_Betty was hugging her tight
10501,I know and Ellen said she was laughing Ellen was like oh my god
10502,oh sweetie do not throw the mouse that is not nice
10503,let's look at the I don't wanna look at that
10504,well I think that's a lil boy wearing pants and a shirt
10505,I don't think Gabby is going to be in New York when we go
10506,but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered
10507,Daddy makes fun of Mommy because Mommy digs out the candied chestnuts from the panettone
10508,oh I wonder if there are any bird's nests in this humongous tree
10509,that's a K and an O which is a circle and that's actually a B but it looks very much like a P my_goodness honey
10510,Phoebe was telling a story to auntie and auntie couldn't hear what she said and Phoebe didn't want to tell the story anymore so auntie said what did you say Phoebe and Phoebe said dede
10511,ooh and you can see that building where mommy use to work

10517,and a raisin too yummy yummy yummy
10518,the kind beetle asked won't you stay here with me
10519,I was a little underwhelmed by it but

10529,did you see a show on tv yesterday where someone had a back+pack
10530,do you remember what the big orange one is honey
10531,I think this branch needs to be cut off because there are no leaves on that branch I think that means that it's sick
10532,I looked for my mom and I found you at last
10533,xxx Jonathan glanced up and down the beach crikey he said look over there
10534,watching the sea lions is always fun but today there's some monkey business going on at the zoo
10535,do you think mommy should just whine and complain everytime you ask for something
10536,the animals led Snow White to a tiny cottage in the woods
10537,the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze
10538,we're still over uh when we saw Don's xxx the other weekend and she said dede
10539,here you gotta keep it on the table and drink it
10540,you must look for the creature who loves you the
10541,all of the monkeys have escaped can you help find them
10542,and mommy likes those pretzels to doesn't she
10543,something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent
10544,she knocked on the door but no one answered
10545,wow you're a lucky lil girl aren't you
10546,it's like you know it's like a big you know long it was in a greenhouse like a big like sort of three connected rooms and there maybe fifty butterflies
10547,so xxx oh that's daddy no how long are we gonna xxx
10548,there was a large bulge on one side and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive
10549,Snow White found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds
10550,ooh all those I don't know is that all that's left remember some broke last time when we were playing with them
10551,do you remember what this one is on the way on the tippy top
10552,it's a nice day out today isn't it
10553,this is like my dad use to say like when he takes out his slide shows from when he was like thirteen
10554,swinging down from a thread she hung on from one
10555,but the cottage was a mess oh my there must be seven tiny children living here
10556,so it was like oh I see one oh there's two ya know and the big sign saying don't touch the butterflies so ya know
10557,suddenly the tent began moving across the sand scattering people in all directions
10558,hey honey can you put this dirty washcloth in the hamper for me
10559,you wanna sing twinkle twinkle little star for Manuela honey
10560,it just missed a large sand castle went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea
10561,watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover
10562,let's clean the house and surprise them she said to her animal companions then maybe they'll let me stay
10563,well you know what let's not step on the cheese let's eat the cheese
10564,she loved the pointy pencils she loved the squeaky chalk and she loved the way her boots went clickety clickety click down the long shiny halls
10565,are you going to go to school one day
10566,do you want Daddy to throw the red red mushy ball with you
10567,it's yeah it's never been because daddy I think was her first word so um it's never
10568,did she squeeze down a hole or dive under water
10569,Paddington cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view
10570,xxx I don't see any stars I see some clouds
10571,are you going to go to school with Tamar
10572,soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarfs
10573,why won't she come out here and meet her new
10574,that's right you got butterfly signs for Alec and for you
10575,and where's the little one what's that one called where we live
10576,oh it's stuck okay see if I can get that out there we go
10577,Snow White promised to wash and sow and sweep for the little men and in return they kept her safe and happy
10578,and she loved the fish sticks and chocolate milk every Friday in the lunch room
10579,here I'll just hold it right there and say hi Jessica
10580,these will be the days where you're like I'm never having children
10581,that's the second time I've had to rescue you
10582,it's like Lily dress dress dress dress dress next page
10583,that it does look kinda like the moon bear
10584,she climbed to the tippy top of a tree
10585,and do you know who else is going to be at the school where you go
10586,hm hey Lily what if we do something fun like we make chocolate chip pancakes
10587,that's a panda bear because he has a white face with black eyes and the moon bear's all black except that he has that little white fuzzy spot under his chin
10588,and most of all she loved her teacher Mister Slinger
10589,the seven dwarfs loved having Snow White stay in their cottage
10590,she always calls him daddy or now she goes hi dad
10591,back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow White was hiding
10592,Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs
10593,Don thinks she shows more of a preference for her I'm not doing it it's upstairs I can't do it
10594,he wore artistic shirts and glasses on a chain around his neck
10595,I don't know if Diane is going to go
10596,I child needs a mother may I help you search
10597,and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week
10598,are we gonna go on a picnic with Alec if it's nice this weekend
10599,what were the moon bears doing when we saw them at the zoo
10600,the queen was so angry that she drank a potion that turned her into an old hag and she created a magic apple
10601,don't hear much from Canada these days do ya
10602,I don't know for sure but I'll offer this clue
10603,um he thinks she shows more of a preference for her laugh but I think it's fifty fifty but she definitely has
10604,remember how I was telling you that Alaska is actually up here but they couldn't fit in the picture
10605,yeah whada you think we should make for out picnic honey because mommy's in charge of the food
10606,Lily we have_to disguise the cookie as something else for breakfast
10607,did you say it has a cone on it or a corn on it
10608,I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy I said it was his Punch and Judy
10609,that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna
10610,know I don't have any room to fall backwards though cause
10611,and do you know what your teacher's name is going to be
10612,with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow White's eyes will close forever she said the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss
10613,if I were your mom I'd be looking for you
10614,xxx cookies aren't supposed to come out for breakfast so we're supposed to pretend they're something else
10615,they were at their house and their home were they sleeping
10616,that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it
10617,they flew through the trees spying down from the sky
10618,I know I thought at this point there would be a preference but maybe not
10619,one of his ear's is a bit wobbly
10620,and you're having a little oh you know what you're having
10621,does it look like popcorn because it's fluffy
10622,instead of greetings students or good morning pupils Mister Slinger winked and said howdy
10623,there's one puppet called Mister Punch and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo
10624,do you want Daddy to throw the ball to you and you can catch it
10625,as soon as the dwarfs went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow White the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarfs
10626,I know but the train track is behind me sweetie
10627,and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever
10628,you wanna sing it so Manuela can hear the words
10629,he thought that desks in rows were old fashioned and boring
10630,remember Trevor and Phoebe had fits the other day
10631,but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone
10632,yeah we saw the Mommy and the Daddy and the baby giraffe right
10633,do you rodents think you can handle a semicircle
10634,if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs
10635,it's brown and what color are your eyes
10636,honey there's a train track behind me I can't fall any further
10637,and he always provided the most tasty snacks
10638,she then asked a small spider and plump as a pig
10639,remember how ridiculous it sounded when Trevor was screaming and whining
10640,it does look like popcorn in the back of the train
10641,things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy
10642,it goes motor boat motor boat goes so slow
10643,a triangle I don't really see anything that looks exactly like a triangle
10644,have you seen my mom she's like me only big
10645,I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lily
10646,and she fell to the floor in a deep sleep
10647,but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up
10648,like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt
10649,walk walk walk walk walk this is what it's supposed to be but I'm helping her
10650,the sly spider laughed as she gobbled his snack
10651,the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarfs raced after her
10652,what else did we see the elephant was pooping
10653,it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show
10654,what color can you you wanna go look and see what color Manuela's eyes are
10655,up there is a mother who's yellow and black
10656,oh yeah there's one pocket where'd you put the other Polly pocket
10657,well he didn't get ice+cream because he was having a fit
10658,motor boat motor boat go so fast step on the gas
10659,with a heart full of joy she peered over the straw
10660,they chased her to a rocky cliff and when a rock broke beneath her feet the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below
10661,so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment
10662,can you show me some of the letters what letters are on that box
10663,let's sing a different song should we sing twinkle twinkle little star
10664,turn the light on let's see if you can tell
10665,you can have a seat in the front row he said to Paddington
10666,when we're cold we can say boy I wish we had some coal
10667,what type of whales did you see at the aquarium
10668,it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw
10669,the broken hearted dwarfs watched over Snow White day and night one day the prince appeared as he had been searching for the beautiful princess
10670,can you see what color Manuela's eyes are
10671,aha we could pretend that's for breakfast couldn't we
10672,so I called one day and it's a big practice
10673,one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside
10674,and do you remember what they have on the top of their head
10675,and you know a bunch of doctors running around
10676,hm are Manuela's eyes are they brown
10677,I'm the teacher she told her baby brother Julius listen up
10678,but all good things come to an end and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar
10679,motor boat motor boat go so fast step on the gas
10680,told her I was a patient of Dr Louis I was wondering if you could ask
10681,they're brown who else's eyes are brown
10682,and the mommy tried to feed miss spider to her babies
10683,Snow White kissed the dwarfs on their forehead and thanked them for all they had done
10684,I thought she wanted to be a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva said her father
10685,I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home he said
10686,okay sweetie mommy has Hondo and Fabian to if you wanna read it
10687,you're rocking you're rocking hm hm hm hm hm hm
10688,Gabi's eyes are very dark brown she has pretty dark brown eyes
10689,I think I shall sleep so well on the way back I may lose all of today's air with my snores
10690,ooh Mommy's picking up the ball with her toes
10691,it must be because of her new teacher Mister Slinger said her mother
10692,that's a T but it looks a lot like an I
10693,before she could blink she was whisked out of sight
10694,once upon a kind king and gentle queen had a baby girl named Aurora
10695,that's a little bird riding a very big bike
10696,there she is she's dressed up like Mister xxx Slinger
10697,I always like when you get British books the language is written so much nicer than
10698,should we see if anyone wants to eat the pie
10699,visitors came to see the baby including king Hubert who ruled a nearby kingdom and his young son prince Philip
10700,no what color daddy's eyes are the color as yours
10701,well I don't think we can fix it we'll have_to look for a new one
10702,let's see if we can find someone who might want to eat that pie in here
10703,that was very good should we sing hey diddle diddle
10704,do you remember where did we go that it was so windy
10705,in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree
10706,do you think Pooh bear wants to eat the pie
10707,the two kings decided that Philip and Aurora would marry one day and unite the kingdoms
10708,whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom
10709,the kind beetle asked won't you stay here with me
10710,it was so it was very warm not Wednesday is was super warm
10711,so I call up and I said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide+lines as to how much tuna a kid can eat
10712,although his are green hazel and yours are like a blue hazel
10713,wow oh she put almost all she put all these pieces in except for the feet
10714,the king and queen were so happy they held a celebration
10715,Tuesday was like eighty though almost eighty seventy five eighty
10716,I looked for my mom and I found you
10717,soon three good fairies Flaura Fauna and Merryweather arrived
10718,huh I don't know it must be other kids in her class
10719,and do you think the pie looks like a triangle
10720,and some of her rhyming books are really good because then she can finish the sentence once she hears it a few times
10721,they came to give magical gifts to the baby princess
10722,because she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna
10723,we went just to fly kites and like take walk and what not
10724,should we put the pie with the triangle shapes
10725,Flaura said my gift shall be the gift of beauty and Fauna said my gift shall be the gift of song
10726,you must look for the creature who loves you the
10727,so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week
10728,when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lily stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus
10729,but before Merryweather could give her gift the evil fairy Malificent appeared
10730,you did and I have it for you it's right inside lemme lemme go get it for you now because I forget every time
10731,can you look at Manuela and see if Manuela can tell what color your eyes are
10732,but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her because she wants it
10733,is that what you say at the doctor's office
10734,Lily do you wanna read your barn book to Manuela
10735,she was so angry that she hadn't been invited that she put a curse on the baby
10736,she raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn't know the answer
10737,that's not what she says because she starts crying
10738,um her's are interesting we still can't tell what color her eyes are I mean we just tell her they're hazel because they're this very in
10739,before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel
10740,you stay over here and I'll get your barn book
10741,and um so I called and the woman's like okay I'll ask like you're crazy
10742,you actually gave it to me two weeks ago and I forgot to
10743,and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
10744,you were driving the car and mommy was carrying you
10745,Merryweather wanted to take away Malificent's curse put her powers were not strong enough
10746,she gets back on the phone she goes Dr Lang said one to two ounces a week like that's like two bites an ounce
10747,I know we used up all our paint stickers
10748,you're right he is wearing a yellow tie
10749,I was telling Manuela about the h e y
10750,so she changed the curse Aurora wouldn't die but would fall into a deep sleep only true love's kiss would break the spell
10751,side lazy aside Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg
10752,I know yeah sometimes they're gray and sometimes they're blue and it's and we can never really tell
10753,one Monday morning Lily came to school especially happy
10754,I'm tired and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg
10755,she had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend and she had a new pair of movie xxx movie star sunglasses complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's
10756,then Flaura came up with a plan the three fairies would transform themselves into peasants and raise the princess deep into the forest until her sixteenth birthday
10757,Lily you're not wearing it now I'm just thinking back
10758,it was a cold cold night on plum street
10759,so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday
10760,it's work how I hate it I'd much rather play
10761,do you think there's a camp for wayward children where we can send you
10762,so this is what they're recommending for that an adult female shouldn't have like should have a can because a big a regular size can of tuna is six ounces
10763,in the little white house Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed
10764,did you tell mommy the story about the crane this morning
10765,should we see if someone if she if there's someone maybe Roo
10766,she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
10767,once the curse ended they would return her to the palace
10768,she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle
10769,he has hazel he has absolutely hazel eyes
10770,let me just pull it up because it's falling down
10771,wanna bring one in to me and I'll roll it out for you
10772,should we see if we can find a picture of Roo
10773,xxx kiss good_night Sam Missus Bear said and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red
10774,many years passed and Malificent had lost her patience it was almost Aurora's sixteenth birthday and she hadn't found the princess
10775,so this is when you were at the video store with Daddy Sweets
10776,when mommy came downstairs what were you doing with the crane
10777,you think you might self destruct if you whine too much
10778,so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two
10779,meanwhile Aurora had grown to be sweet and lovely on her sixteenth birthday the fairies sent her out to pick berries while they prepared a surprise party
10780,do you think baby Ariel might self destruct if you whine too much
10781,hers are his are I think hers are hazel but maybe their blue hazel or something
10782,Chester had his own way of doing things
10783,and there sat Sam curled up and small and coughing in his bed
10784,not now said Mister Slinger let's be considerate of our classmates
10785,it's got like brown in the inside and kind of like a bluish greyish green
10786,what should we sing do you wanna pick a song
10787,he always got out of bed on the same side
10788,are we gonna go to the supermarket later
10789,xxx or a diva or a pilot or a hairdresser or a scuba diver
10790,and he never left the house without double knotting his shoes
10791,I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy
10792,didjou tell Manuela you got the Ariel movie
10793,and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development
10794,what are you going to buy to eat at the supermarket
10795,Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek
10796,and then we'll find someone for her to give the medicine to
10797,what other songs do you like to sing sweet stuff
10798,and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket
10799,oh let's see it looks like she maybe she's a pilot there she's flying
10800,you have a cough she said and she dashed down the stairs and up again with
10801,well just because you're very special mommy bought it for you
10802,Aurora and the prince met and quickly fell in love but Aurora wouldn't tell the prince her name because the fairies had warned her to never speak to strangers
10803,you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on
10804,you like the songs you like well that makes perfect sense
10805,two Ariel movies right the one where Ariel is with her daddy and Eric and the other one where Ariel's a mommy to Melody right
10806,you definitely have a mind of your own said Chester's mother
10807,do we have a picture of Pooh sitting on a pink chair
10808,that's one way to put it said Chester's father
10809,but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people
10810,even so she invited the prince to visit their cottage that night
10811,what do you want mommy to do spread it out
10812,Chester's best friend Wilson was exactly the same way
10813,back at the cottage the fairies were having trouble making Aurora Aurora's birthday present birthday party extra special
10814,we could put that in the back where it says
10815,Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first
10816,my mom sent it to her so we have_to bring it to New York with us
10817,just as Malificent's raven was flying overhead the colorful sparklers from their magic wands shot out of the cottage's chimney
10818,she would literally eat it everyday if she could
10819,Wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless Chester wanted to and they always used hand signals
10820,you know what we're having dinner with Ronnie and Alec and Mark in a couple days so we have_to buy stuff for dinner
10821,I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip
10822,as soon as he saw the magic the raven flew back to the forbidden mountain to tell Malificent he had found the fairies and the princess
10823,if Chester was hungry Wilson was to
10824,okay this says that the kite is a yellow diamond
10825,top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever
10826,oy oy did you tell me to take the fuzz off of you yesterday
10827,we're gonna bring that to New York and you're gonna read it to gramma Rosie
10828,some days I can't tell those two apart said Wilson's mother
10829,that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny
10830,my Mom said I used to do this all the time when I was little I would just bring books and go read read
10831,Aurora returned home and told the fairies about the handsome stranger she'd met the fairies explained she was a princess and was promised to prince Philip then the fairies set off to return the sad princess to her home her parents
10832,right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant
10833,once when Wilson accidentally swallowed a watermelon seed and cried because he was afraid a watermelon plant would grow inside him
10834,there's a bag shoes well I don't think he wears a dress
10835,right there was an octopus you're right is Ursula and octopus
10836,Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside
10837,you want you think you'd like to work with the sea lions at the aquarium
10838,what would be good to make for dinner for Ronnie and Mark
10839,when they reached the palace the fairies left Aurora alone while they went to find her parents suddenly a strange glow appeared
10840,soon it will snow she said open wide Sam and afterward we'll go downstairs and wait for snow
10841,don't worry said Chester if you grow a watermelon plant I'll grow one to
10842,everyone's very busy at school today including the class gerbil he likes stories too xxx
10843,Chester duplicated his Christmas list every year and gave a copy to Wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway
10844,he sputtered and snorted and made a big face but the syrup went down
10845,in a trance the Princess followed the light into the room with a spinning wheel in it touch the spindle the evil fairy commanded powerless the princess obeyed and pricked her finger
10846,I don't know what she's looking for actually
10847,what do we call it when he wears his coat and his shirt and his pants
10848,the poor transcriber is gonna be like oh my God how do I how do I transcribe xxx

10858,and who's gonna go to school with you
10859,we really shouldn't put a piece that big in our mouth it's too big to chew
10860,Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too
10861,they really are two peas in a pod said Chester's mother
10862,Malificent then found the prince and locked him in her dungeon but the good fairies appeared and they realized it was prince Philip
10863,and what's your teacher's name in school
10864,they lit a little fire in the kitchen and made a pot of

10886,now let's see if we like it or we think it's scary
10887,Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam
10888,you're right auntie gave you block too honey
10889,Lily had her own way of doing things
10890,Philip threw his sword at the dragon with all his might and the beast plunged over the edge of the cliff

10900,Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked

10902,he knelt beside the princess and kissed her gently
10903,Arthur has to do some shopping can you help him find everything on his list
10904,and they smell good those are the best smelling ones

11820,Dora's backpack and the little mermaid which one should we read first
11821,well if you'd like to share my stone soup you can bring something small to put into the soup

11830,I don't think the trains are gonna fit in there
11831,um well we're here until for about another um forty minutes and the guy's coming to look at the kitchen floor that's
11832,under the sea was a bustling kingdom of mer+people presided over by the just and noble king

11834,would you like to draw a picture on the back of your school page
11835,you're not gonna sit on Mama's lap if you do that
11836,and they all put something yummy into the soup and it cooks and cooks with the magic stone and at the end it tastes so delicious and they all share the soup together
11837,I know I don't know why they made the pears blue but they are
11838,one day Paddington decided to make a list of all the nice things there were about being a bear and living with the Brown's at number thirty two Winsor Gardens
11839,hats where should he be wearing the hats
11840,in the museum lobby Mister_Owl went over the rules
11841,Danielle said in her letter that you could draw something on the back of here look
11842,king Tritan forbade the mer+people to go above the water but whenever his youngest daughter Ariel could she and her best friend Flounder would sneak up the surface
11843,and I think his mommy's making eggs
11844,why don't you go pick some more books out
11845,no shouting no running and stay with the group
11846,but by the way Ronnie is going into the hospital today to have her baby so she won't be there
11847,normally I think pears are kind of yellow or green or brown but that is a blue pear tree
11848,how spiders spin sheet webs in the corners of rooms
11849,have a garage sale said mother and have it today
11850,yeah she looks like she has sort of little feathers on her head too

11852,let's get I think you need some sugar for your dough too
11853,oh that one's upstairs how about Franklin rides a bike
11854,but Franklin didn't he moved a little closer to Mister_Owl

11857,oh my xxx he needs to put his pants on
11858,alright I think I'm going to come tomorrow yeah
11859,yeah sure I bet beach stones would make good soup

11862,I can't believe you're selling the bionic bunny jet fighter said Buster

11866,oh that sheep is sweating he's so hot
11867,because I don't because I can't bring Lily with me so tomorrow I can have Don watch her and I can pop over to the hospital

11874,that's the sound bats make to find their way around
11875,it was quiet and peacefully and there were times when it might not have been in London at all
11876,Franklin was relieved that it was bats and not dinosaurs
11877,because it could be very messy for a pig
11878,you know what you're gonna do at school you're going to play outside and you're gonna listen to stories and you're gonna have a snack
11879,many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have_to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand
11880,all of a sudden a storm broke and the sky turned dark thunder boomed and lightening crashed
11881,I think that's a bug bite that you're xxx scratching there
11882,I know can you does Thomas have any dirt on him
11883,but nice gardens usually mean a lot of hard work
11884,that's right and he's his carrots fell onto his tie
11885,it is a chicken house but I don't think it goes there
11886,oh that is so funny I'm not sure Sweets oh that
11887,howling wind tore at the ship's sails and giant waves tossed the vessel onto the jagged rocks
11888,and after a day at his office Mr Brown often wished it wasn't quite so large
11889,it's your prize wow where did you get it
11890,you can plant them in a garden or in pots
11891,yeah maybe some butter too you think you need butter in your your little mixture
11892,yeah maybe we shouldn't scratch it because it makes the itch worse
11893,you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months
11894,remember that little thing where you get the drawers to like move the moustache and everything with little magnets
11895,Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly
11896,um we have_to look Honey hang on just a second and I'll look with you
11897,okay be gentle because that's Manuela's honey we don't want it to break
11898,there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs
11899,Ariel frantically searched for the prince and when she spotted him she quickly swam over to him and pulled him to safety
11900,well Mommy did the other side so this is for you to do
11901,um yeah that's okay that's okay um I shall call you later and we'll make a time for tomorrow
11902,oh my gosh he laid her egg in her pants
11903,indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside
11904,so I don't think we have_to wear them now right
11905,well you it's yours for the hour you're right while Manuela's here but Manuela takes it back with her and she baby+sits the box
11906,that's what's on here like little shady things hanging I guess xxx
11907,in the medieval room Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight
11908,did I tell you where Aunt_Jill and Uncle_Steve were this week
11909,once they were on shore Ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince
11910,let's see what else can we tell Manuela what else did we do over the summer
11911,he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
11912,xxx we saw knights in the other museum in New_York at the Metropolitan right
11913,let's see we're gonna put the
11914,at last he began to awaken minutes later the prince's servant sir Grimsby discovered him a girl rescued me said the prince groggily and she had the most beautiful voice
11915,it was Mrs Brown who first thought of giving Jonathan Judy and Paddington a piece each of their own
11916,let's see where does that go that's a very good question can I see
11917,kangaroo already has a pocket I don't think the kangaroo needs another one
11918,your bionic bunny spy glasses said Arthur okay great trade
11919,wouldjou like mommy to get a book or wouldjou like to get a book
11920,all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl
11921,he was the first one to find an arrow head
11922,he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels right
11923,you know what Honey I think that there was a little stick in here and then this went on top of it but I don't know where the stick is oh but here's the little wheel look
11924,you need an egg to put in your mixture there

11926,you are do you need help oh good job sweetie should we see who let's see who's in that book
11927,okay why don't you go pick a book out then
11928,so Mr Brown marked up three squares and to make it more exciting he said he would give a price to whom ever had the best idea
11929,just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince and every maiden in the land is invited
11930,then Francine came along with a wagon filled with comic books
11931,it was just like being a real archaeologist
11932,in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
11933,my mom's making me get rid of these she said sadly oh boy cool cat comics said Arthur
11934,an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things
11935,xxx this book and she didn't notice I was there and she read the entire book out loud
11936,you know what we are going to see grandma and grandpa tomorrow we're going to take an airplane tomorrow
11937,are you caught let's see who's in this book oh my look it's xxx cover xxx department again

11939,all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
11940,wow said Francine is that a real World cup soccer game
11941,the best part is still to come said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria
11942,I mean like not word for word but some of the words word for word like his eyes shot back open she says eye shot open and ya know or the whole thing but then of course once I'm there she won't do it anymore so like I said to her last night why don't you read it to daddy ah no
11943,she practiced and practiced and then went to the park to show off
11944,she's standing outside the door like this
11945,Judy thought she would grow some flowers and Jonathan started to make a paved garden
11946,as the days grow shorter and colder in the fall some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter
11947,almost new said Arthur I'll trade for your comics
11948,why don't you draw a picture of Mommy and Daddy and Lily
11949,is it first we look for the crack hang on
11950,oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
11951,look at me she said I can ride my bike all by myself
11952,and I'll just keep talking and talking and talking because I refuse to put a period at the end of my sentence
11953,meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of Ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king Tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom
11954,I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
11955,news spread and Arthur's friends all came with things to trade
11956,Mister_Owl smiled I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit
11957,gardening was much harder than it looked
11958,oh my gosh that billy+goat is eating his own pants
11959,well the red one I think we've pretty much lost for good the yellow one let me just go throw this out Sweetie Pie
11960,because Danielle said in her letter she wanted you to draw a picture
11961,Binky this is so cool said Arthur what is it
11962,Franklin gulped I'm too tired to see more I think I'll stay here a while he muttered
11963,oh a butterfly how pretty that's called a monarch butterfly
11964,especially with paws and he soon grew tired of digging
11965,xxx great and then we'll throw the egg shell away good job Sweets
11966,there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
11967,it's my punching bag said Binky I want to trade it for your sailor Sam xxx
11968,in the end he decided to do some shopping
11969,suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
11970,it is aunt Jill you're right let's see who else we have here xxx Matthew
11971,why don't you tell Manuela about when you went swimming in the big pool
11972,um the yellow one is probably around here somewhere but I'm not sure where
11973,she stared at the image of Ariel and Flounder in her crystal ball this pretty little daughter of his may be the key to Tritan's undoing she said
11974,you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs said Mister_Owl
11975,it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
11976,Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
11977,I know where is that part I don't know

11981,well uh some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's plenty of food this is called migration
11982,wouldjou like to read the best little word book ever with lowly worm
11983,reluctantly Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long leafy corridor
11984,her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
11985,he went swimming and his clothes got all wet
11986,right now you have_to stir it up with your spoon okay
11987,no he's just wearing shorts his legs are naked you have fun in the park

11996,he got his antlers stuck in his suspenders
11997,Franklin was worried that his friends would make fun of his training wheels
11998,you're holding a little puppy a little black and white puppy
11999,that means when it gets cold out Honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's called migration
12000,Mommy loves to lie in the sun even though it's so bad for her
12001,especially since he had two pence left over
12002,he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus
12003,and he destroyed all of Ariel's human treasures Ariel had that Ariel had collected from the surface
12004,so he lied and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
12005,okay can you draw your little picture first and then we'll get Blankie
12006,there's a that was a little girl there in the black who hold your big puppy for a little bit then she gave it back to you xxx you're playing with Matthew
12007,the shop keeper told him that when planning a new garden it was a good idea to stand some way away first in order to picture what it would look like when it was finished
12008,it looks like you're holding someone's credit card
12009,Ariel was very upset and she sought Ursula's help
12010,but most of all because it might be very embarrassing
12011,in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter
12012,in exchange for the mermaid's voice Ursula would transform Ariel's tail into legs
12013,oh my gosh what kind of is that a space shuttle
12014,the water in the eye is a big thing now like every bath
12015,the elephant is wearing the same dress as the woman
12016,and Fern had a typewriter that Arthur really liked
12017,there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years
12018,and wiggles but you know what he likes a lot now he likes Dora now too
12019,gave your big puppy back to you but there you are holding your puppy
12020,hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
12021,so taking a jar of his best chunky marmalade
12022,but she said the prince must fall in love with you by sunset on the third day that is he's got_to kiss you
12023,I know but who's this sitting right here
12024,many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter
12025,Arthur was happy his old stuff was gone
12026,Paddington set out to visit the near by building site
12027,yeah ooh that's good look Amanda's gonna clip it for you
12028,D_W ran to the garage you didn't sell your jolly jingle maker she said
12029,mommy tries not to get water in your eye right when we wash the shampoo out of your hair
12030,as they were leaving Franklin and his friends walked past the egyptian
12031,who did we see when we were in New York last week
12032,by the time he got there it was the middle of the morning
12033,where's the girl she went for a walk with her mommy and daddy
12034,but I got rid of all my other stuff said Arthur
12035,Ursula took her mermaid tail away and gave her legs instead right
12036,and as the men were all at their tea break he sat down on a pile of bricks
12037,you're in their little baby swimming pool when you were a little baby in your diaper
12038,we saw a big stingray what else did we see at the aquarium
12039,next time said Beaver you should visit the tomb there's a mummy inside

12045,he wouldn't talk to Wanda Sue and he never went near the phone
12046,Lily you wanna take wanna lie down and take a nap with Mommy
12047,afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
12048,and if prince Eric didn't kiss her on the third day Ariel would change back into a mermaid and become Ursula's slave forever
12049,well he said I didn't really get any money
12050,you're holding the hose and there's water coming out of it
12051,can you put some green and yellow and orange and then we'll be done
12052,oh you gotta keep mixing till it's all mushy
12053,um I think it's just a tiny piece of skin honey you don't have_to pull it off xxx
12054,everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
12055,it's a new day said Charles' mother let's go in the store and say hello
12056,I'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's pretty huh
12057,after sitting there for some while without getting a single idea pit
12058,but I got all this great new stuff said Arthur
12059,and I'll write a rainbow next to it so Danielle knows what it is
12060,he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
12061,a short time later prince Eric and his dog Max found Ariel on the beach
12062,and he hardly could hardly wait to tell her all about his adventures at the museum
12063,as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
12064,that's right grandma Barbara says whoopsie poopsie
12065,if Mom sees this said D_W you're in big trouble
12066,we'll buy a sweet potato pie and say goodbye before right
12067,you want Mommy to help you mix it a little bit more
12068,you seem very familiar to me he said have we met
12069,Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell into the flower bed
12070,everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
12071,these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter
12072,you're right he said but what are we going to do
12073,that's true we did see them they swim
12074,are we gonna go to the toy store later
12075,baby in her diaper in her diaper with her naked belly
12076,wonderful morning said Missus_Balinsky a chocolate surprise for my beautiful boy
12077,let's see what do we think we should do today
12078,when he got back his eyes nearly popped out
12079,they were swimming swimming swimming and then they would land on the ground and take a rest
12080,Ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it Eric thought it couldn't be her because she couldn't speak much less sing
12081,I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
12082,the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
12083,say thank you whispered Charles' mother thank you yelled Mrs Balinsky
12084,later that day Arthur's mother went to check his room
12085,let's see what else did we do over the summer
12086,ooh that's a nice little branch isn't it
12087,the best time to use the maps is at around eleven P M on a clear night away from city lights
12088,we'll have_to see I don't know if it's warm enough for the swim club
12089,a man was emptying the concrete mixer on the very spot where he had left his jar of marmalade
12090,Honey I don't want you to fall off the couch
12091,yeah a little bit more red I think you can't see the red that much
12092,did we go to Tamar's beach house one day

12094,he crossed his fingers and held his breath
12095,okay you wanna come in the kitchen and help mommy make cookies
12096,his mother told him say goodbye Charles hid in a flour sack
12097,you know Mommy and Daddy grew up in the city and we never saw any stars because there were so many lights in the city
12098,for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out

12166,that's the swimming pool in the hotel where Grandma and Grandpa were staying
12167,and no one will give me two pence for it now
12168,in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow

12356,oh no that storm cloud made the ground all wet
12357,I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
12358,but Maurice and his horse Philippe never made it to the fair they got lost and saw a castle
12359,come now said Mrs Pots gently all you have_to do is show her what's inside your heart you must act like a gentleman Lumiere said
12360,he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
12361,riding a bike is difficult said his mother
12362,I don't know it was a little something sticky

12378,and don't be so grumpy added Chip Mrs Pots young son
12379,great I need your help to pull Boots out of the sand
12380,baked potatoes are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day
12381,do you think everything comes easy for them she asked
12382,at that very moment Gaston a local hunter had arrived at Belle's house to propose marriage
12383,I don't know who splashed with you is it a girl or a boy
12384,there it goes that's a big train with a lot of cars
12385,Mrs Pots gave her son a stern look but they all knew Chip was right
12386,and there are play pieces and a scale and a shopping basket and shelves
12387,Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince_Eric
12388,what's it called that the camera sits on
12389,he saved my life moaned Missus_Block he's a prince a gem a hero
12390,say you'll marry me he said but Belle refused there was no way she'd marry that conceited bully

12396,before we get into the boat what should we wear to be safe
12397,swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
12398,and everyone shouted thank you Charles but Charles said
12399,I have an idea said the beast smiling why don't I invite Belle to go on a sleigh ride
12400,what do you wanna do with the egg you just wanna crack it into the bowl
12401,oh you're right he is riding his bicycle
12402,just then Philippe arrived with no rider where's papa
12403,do you tell stories about the stone or does the stone itself tell stories
12404,what else did you see in the museum when we were in New York
12405,no I don't think we saw lions at the zoo yesterday
12406,below are two suggestions for different fillings
12407,well I don't know you tell me Graham Charlie Steven or Henry
12408,with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing

12410,yup they're a lot of stars on those stickers you're right
12411,it just snowed outside and she might like the fresh air

12414,I don't suppose she's French so maybe she just said where's papa huh
12415,does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato
12416,suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
12417,each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
12418,perfect said Lumiere a wonderful idea agreed Mrs Pots
12419,that's right they're orange with a little bit of yellow on it
12420,Belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle
12421,and two eggy hands oh wait you've got eggy feet too
12422,really it doesn't sound so good to Mommy
12423,no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
12424,she sang a song she had written just for Eric
12425,Swiper's trying to swipe out life jackets
12426,maybe it was Steven Steven has very very blonde hair doesn't he
12427,did you see the movie about the African dancers
12428,that's an awfully neat little piggie+bank you got at the dentist's office
12429,how'd your feet end up with egg on them
12430,added Chip that's enough out of you Mrs Pots said to Chip trying not to smirk
12431,easy for you said Beaver she tried once more and fell again
12432,I'm the master of this castle roared the beast
12433,xxx do you want me to get froggy so you don't have_to climb up the stairs with your little box
12434,these look like fun these are little pretend oreos that have little different shapes in them so you can match them together
12435,hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
12436,Mommy spilled it and it doesn't even matter
12437,and that one too is that eggy too
12438,come on I need you to climb up on to this stool
12439,that's the back of a life jacket she's putting it on
12440,I think I have some food stickers do you want them
12441,that sounds lovely said Belle I've been stuck in this castle far too long
12442,I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
12443,well I didn't see it so you would hafta tell me
12444,cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato
12445,oh I like the b and you like the p huh
12446,she was afraid to put her head underwater
12447,right but you don't want to bring up that it's inappropriate for her to do that
12448,she put one arm in and she's going to put the other arm in
12449,oh gosh I don't know if we have anyone small enough to fit in that apple car
12450,still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
12451,she ran down the long staircase and stepped outside
12452,it's easy said Franklin just do it
12453,your cow and your bear I think they're upstairs too
12454,you hafta tell me because I wasn't there
12455,glimmering white snow flakes fell from the sky it was a perfect white day
12456,when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
12457,I just put them in a little baggie for you
12458,thanks for helping us swipe stop Swiper now we can cross Turtle river
12459,you can go anywhere you like he said to Belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner
12460,it took her a long time to feel good in the water
12461,that sounds good to me does it sound good to you
12462,he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
12463,ooh you know what Sweetie this one I'm not gonna put that in there let me see what else I can get for you
12464,just then the beast pulled up in a gleaming horse drawn sleigh
12465,I'll carry it for you you wanna carry it
12466,no you wanna stay in there for a very long time
12467,now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
12468,mm you know what let's put it on the paper not the puzzle
12469,who are you he called out into the night
12470,were you xxx did you have some egg on the bottom of your foot

12472,oh the cymbals maybe does he go like this
12473,back at the castle the beast waited for Belle to join him for dinner master said Lumiere this girl could be the one to break the spell
12474,the beast smiled as he took her hand and helped her into the sleigh
12475,xxx there it is here we are at the library
12476,but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
12477,he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her
12478,I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home
12479,she'll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast
12480,do you wanna pick a book out Sweetie you wanna read a book
12481,once she was settled he covered her with a warm blanket
12482,ooh we'll have_to ask Gabi later we were gonna ask Gabi later if she could come we thought maybe Daddy and David could take you and Gabi to Fantasy land later
12483,but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and Belle shared a wonderful dance
12484,and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things
12485,that was fun for you to play with Steven
12486,we did it now we can return my library books on time
12487,they took off across the powdery snow Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path
12488,map says the candy bag is at the haunted house
12489,you're laughing and you have little teddy bears on your legs
12490,the beast asked Belle if she was happy
12491,and the tomato excellent honey very nice thank you very very nice thank you very much
12492,just a little tiny bit of a mess and we cleaned it up now look how the eggs get mixed in
12493,xxx did you hear that daddy my best friend part
12494,right we did see the mommy swimming but we didn't see the baby right
12495,we have_to follow the candy trail through the spooky forest past the
12496,oh yes said Belle if only I could see my father
12497,let's see should we turn the page and put them on a new page
12498,Lily's sandwiches all have_to be flower shaped these days xxx
12499,xxx Mommy's gonna hafta get a hard candy because I can't stop coughing
12500,soon they came to a clearing in the woods before then was a frozen pond
12501,okay here let me get you a measuring cup
12502,yummy and spider food and beetle food too huh
12503,see we're gonna mix it into the butter and the sugar
12504,so the beast brought Belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it
12505,it was like a daddy my best friend xxx
12506,uh you wanna stay okay you stay outside for a minute Mommy'll be right back okay
12507,oh maybe I think you might be right does it fit
12508,the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the xxx the edge of the pond
12509,it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge
12510,here you go you can pour your water into your bowl
12511,and the wildlife team look at the wildlife team with their animals that's neat
12512,maybe that would help me stop coughing whaddya think
12513,I don't think you have teddy bears on your
12514,but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me
12515,it's uh like these little graduated like cookie cutters so they have different all different sizes
12516,Mommy's going to look at the new light I'll be right back
12517,this is such a magical place said Belle how did you ever find it
12518,hooray for Backpack we couldn't have done it without her
12519,choo choo the barrette's going for a train ride
12520,oh my gosh Spiberus brought food too what did he bring
12521,you're going you're going to drink water
12522,put your nose right at the top of the bottle and smell
12523,I used to come here long ago said the beast it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you
12524,she left the castle and found her father and brought him home
12525,this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand
12526,xxx I hope so Sweetie we have_to make sure that Gabi is free to go
12527,so Sweetie you and I hafta talk about what snack we're gonna bring next week to school
12528,oh that was so nice of Spiberus he must have been in a very good mood
12529,yeah you were riding in stroller that's right
12530,but suddenly Gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father's crazy he think thinks he's seen a beast
12531,and oh yes there's the pirate ship and the construction site that's pretty neat too isn't it
12532,Mommy's gonna getting another book for us
12533,oh the barrette's gonna go into the store with the elephant
12534,I think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some
12535,then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks
12536,yeah honey let's keep it together so it doesn't squish all over
12537,when we go out later for an adventure with Gabby if you want
12538,what type of food do you think Spiberus likes do you think he brought some yummy marigolds
12539,but Belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd
12540,xxx Mommy doesn't hafta bring a snack to her school
12541,we'll turn it just a little faster like that
12542,okay do you want Mommy to make something out of clay too
12543,although Mommy usually has coffee at her school because she's so tired
12544,and then we could see some really neat birds
12545,I bought it especially for you because I thought would like it because you love red peppers right
12546,oh the cat's looking for some milk you're right
12547,Gaston locked Belle and her father in the cellar and set off to find the beast
12548,but Honey you can't really eat it because it's dangerous for a little girl to eat hard candy
12549,and we're gonna put our bananas in
12550,what are you favorite foods these days Honey
12551,Lily do you like nuts in your cookies or just chocolate chips
12552,Danielle thought it might be fun if we brought snacks that maybe kids weren't used to having and they could try something new
12553,now what kind of store are they going into
12554,that sounds like a good snack doesn't it
12555,Belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle
12556,oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon
12557,when Belle and her father arrived the beast had Gaston by the throat
12558,when they had finished their meal the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate
12559,yeah you ate all the chocolate chips already Sweets
12560,let me go cried Gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him
12561,oh you know what we used the bananas in our thing
12562,orange and green and red orange and green and red what
12563,it's gonna make your hand all sticky
12564,that's true actually we need to get a pan
12565,oh yes she said father and I used to go every winter I love ice skating
12566,I wonder if raspberries are in season we'll hafta see
12567,all the whales are gonna go in one bowl okay
12568,Honey you definitely do not need anymore chips
12569,someone else has our frying pan so what pan are we gonna use
12570,different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter
12571,oh come on let's sing a song what should we sing
12572,soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface
12573,you're making a sad pumpkin and wax be trained
12574,and maybe xxx two bowls let's see who we should put in
12575,although not so much green right you like the orange and the yellow and the red peppers right
12576,the beast was less graceful hitting a bump in the ice he lost his balance and toppled to the ground
12577,you could have something else to eat like perhaps you would like
12578,some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation
12579,who do you think would like to go in the second bowl together
12580,xxx the rolling pin can you take the rolling pin out
12581,really but you're supposed to keep your microphone on
12582,oh yeah that's right my gosh I didn't even get to speak to you yesterday
12583,would you like to lick the bowl when we're done
12584,as the beast embraced Belle Gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar
12585,I don't know maybe xxx we haven't had them in class yet
12586,do you want to read this one to Mommy and then Mommy will read this one to you
12587,others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter
12588,at first he was angry but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly
12589,do you think they would like them with the seeds
12590,how did it go by the way and then I will call you back later what's that
12591,Gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again
12592,I wonder if some of the kids wouldn't like the seeds but
12593,remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet
12594,should we use one of those I think we might be able to use one of these
12595,the scarecrow says we can find candy behind two pumpkins that match
12596,but it's a fun fruit to try that's a good idea we can see if the supermarket has raspberries
12597,well let me put the flour in we're almost done
12598,the beast collapsed in Belle's arms you came back he said at least I got_to see you one more time
12599,every one falls sometimes said Belle it's part of learning
12600,one of our mushy pans let's see how xxx
12601,xxx well I can't flick it off when I'm inside see because there's a window there
12602,well it's not ready to lick yet hang on just a second
12603,before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air
12604,alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter
12605,who's got a lolly in the morning on Halloween
12606,I don't have any olives and feta cheese but maybe we can buy some later
12607,mushy pan you wanna mix your dough up and put it into a mushy pan
12608,I of course cannot eat popcorn because I am allergic xxx
12609,and at Belle's words the beast xxx became human again
12610,you tell Amanda we had a big beetle on our steps
12611,okay well you can't have these because these are in the cookies
12612,oh yeah it's hard to take seeds out of raspberries you sort of hafta eat it all together with the seeds in it but that's okay they're tasty right
12613,that loves everything she loves is either really salty or really sweet so she loves pickles and olives and feta and she loves obviously anything with sugar
12614,it's me he said to Belle and all the household servants became human too
12615,just then a timid fawn wandered out of the forest
12616,well that's right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right
12617,poor thing said Belle she looks scared and hungry
12618,Sweetie what else do you think we need to get at the supermarket when we go
12619,xxx do you wanna read frog and toad to me
12620,taking an apple from their picnic basket Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer
12621,you hafta be careful on that because that's very tall
12622,we're having Trevor and Peter sleeping over tonight we've got the whole crew
12623,ashes ashes we all fall down yay good singing honey
12624,that's a good idea maybe we'll bring strawberries or raspberries with us
12625,bugs that's right sometimes they shed their skin
12626,it does look like a funny little hat doesn't it
12627,Mommy's gonna put this in the fridge
12628,soon the sun was setting it was time to go as they made their way home Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast
12629,let's see what it says about summer and spring okay
12630,I need to return eight books to the library and backpack's going to help me
12631,look the candy trail leads right up to the door of the haunted house
12632,here's what you do when you hold your microphone like that you say hello ladies and gentlemen
12633,yeah um so I will call you back in a little bit
12634,and what was Franklin the turtle doing at school yesterday

12744,I bet the only person who loves cookies more than Daddy is Lily
12745,you know what I don't have any more bread those were our last two slices Mommy has to go buy some more bread
12746,everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
12747,Leslie told me about the anemone's name was Bob that's a good name for it
12748,okay but let's be gentle because we don't want them to break
12749,home my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi

12758,did you look out the window when we were on the airplane
12759,would you like sit on the egg in my nest

12761,there he is whada you say to swiper
12762,what did you see out the window when we were on the airplane
12763,I think New_Hampshire's next to Maine can you find it
12764,the elephant laughed why of all silly things I haven't feathers and I haven't
12765,one of the doctors that my grandmother had actually it's like no one could remember his name he's from India and we kept calling him doctor Mufasa
12766,no because clownie wasn't there anymore right
12767,he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing
12768,there it is very good it's the green one on this map
12769,me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small maam and I'm so
12770,thanks for helping us stop swiper now we can cross the river and we're almost at the library
12771,suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming oh no she said I've never been to a ball I don't even know how to dance
12772,do you remember what Nemo's home is called where Nemo and his daddy live
12773,can you take some chocolate chips out of this bag and put them in there
12774,oh you know what they look pretty good to me today
12775,but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels
12776,right a Koosh ball but it doesn't fit in
12777,xxx but like that's not his name xxx I mean not to his face but like just us
12778,don't worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
12779,no Nemo's in the ocean he's always in the ocean
12780,in the Spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
12781,oh no the door is closed but we can use spanish to open it
12782,we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
12783,your egg is so small maam and I'm so
12784,Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first
12785,with that Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand
12786,that's right that's a goblin's tushy look at that
12787,she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off
12788,yes Bloat your puffer fish that's right
12789,New_Hampshire's colorful fall leaves crisp winters and quiet villages are typical of new England states
12790,dance please he asked Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand
12791,ooh let me move this very large knife away from you
12792,as part of the celebration I had a special duty I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
12793,tut tut answered Maisy I know you're not small but I'm sure you can do it
12794,we did it now we can return my library books
12795,Gus was the conductor he got all the birds to sing
12796,look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
12797,wow the world's fastest wind speed was recorded on the top of mount Washington which is a very tall mountain in New_Hampshire
12798,a map on the map on the map on the map
12799,can you count the books to make sure we have all eight
12800,Jacques and Perla spun around and around gliding across the floor
12801,early in the spring frogs lay their eggs which are called frog spawn
12802,I'm ready to try again Franklin told his mother
12803,and I lifted the future king up high for all to see
12804,and we'll spray it and you can lick the bowl hang on
12805,it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
12806,right that's right because the diver took Nemo back to his office right
12807,not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
12808,Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
12809,maybe they do they think they wanna wear princess underpants those goblins
12810,that's Val the octopus should we count the books to make sure Val has eight
12811,soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
12812,Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell many times but he never gave up
12813,do they go we did it we did it we did it hooray
12814,we're going on a picnic said Bear come on
12815,they had a rock in New_Hampshire that looked like an old man in a mountain
12816,just listen and move see said Perla not so scary
12817,this was Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
12818,Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
12819,it's yours and do you remember where you got it
12820,using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
12821,see that was his nose and his mouth and everyone used to look at it but last year the rock fell down
12822,moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
12823,yeah I just call that the we did it song
12824,he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
12825,hooray for backpack we couldn't have done it without her or you
12826,let's get this dough stick that dough in the freezer for a minute
12827,where did you go with Trevor and Phoebe that you got your sparkle stick
12828,Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba you should have been first in line
12829,xxx probably coulda gone with a smaller loaf pan but it's okay
12830,yeah it's a little bit hot we're gonna let it cool off
12831,good Cinderella said Jacques beaming a lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderelli
12832,frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond
12833,finally he was riding his bike all by himself
12834,I was first in line until the little hair ball born and with that Scar stalked out of the cave
12835,Deb is she a yellow fish what color oh blue she's blue and yellow
12836,and the mice collapsed on the floor laughing thank you so much Cinderella said to her friends
12837,I can do it he shouted and rode to the park to show his friends
12838,it's still a little hot I'm gonna blow on it
12839,before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
12840,with your help tonight might be the night all my dreams come true
12841,okay Mommy's just gonna get a book I'll be right back
12842,xxx the New_Hampshire quarter has a picture of the man on the mountain
12843,can you tell Manuela that you're gonna see the Nemo movie when it opens
12844,Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over
12845,blue and white right okay Deb is blue and white okay who else did he meet
12846,early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
12847,that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right
12848,oh let me hold this for one second Honey I think that's Luke
12849,as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
12850,that's what they look like it kind of looks
12851,just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right
12852,not everything is as easy at it looks
12853,oh look your little fish are on the floor with Flounder
12854,sort of looks like a frog but sort of looks like a fish
12855,we need to go to the supermarket and buy more baking things
12856,afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
12857,look Simba everything the light touches is our kingdom
12858,are you gonna get some popcorn in the movie theater
12859,xxx there's a light right next to you too Amanda if you want
12860,spilled a little bit of flour there didn't I
12861,oh Honey I don't think you can fit in there
12862,the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
12863,and they come to the surface of the water to breathe
12864,that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
12865,would you like to read some books Honey
12866,you're you're right they tried to catch the rainbow with their lassos but the rainbow was gone
12867,he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
12868,what movie did you see in the movie what was your first movie that you saw in the movie theater
12869,after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs
12870,later as Simba headed back to the path he ran into Scar
12871,Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered
12872,oh you know what Honey we're not gonna take the bicycle out now because it's a little
12873,hurry up flounder cried Ariel it's almost time for the party we can't be late
12874,hey uncle Scar guess what I'm going to be king of Pride rock my dad showed me the whole kingdom
12875,just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind
12876,that's right we saw Pooh and Piglet Piglet's big movie right
12877,oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are
12878,trying not to make a sound Ariel and flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
12879,the helium's sort of worn out of it so it doesn't fly up to the sky anymore
12880,that's where the grandmas and grandpas live
12881,I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
12882,come be a good fellow I know you won't mind
12883,I think mommy has to write that in your baby book I don't know if I wrote that down
12884,he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders said Scar
12885,I can't said the elephant please begged the bird I won't be gone long sir I give you my word
12886,for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
12887,they began their journey towards the surface but Ariel said flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
12888,you think you like the tunnel I know you like the tunnel
12889,Tigger's gonna be my best friend
12890,I think there's a starfish in the tank isn't there
12891,should we read the story about Mr Frumble and P S Pig
12892,okay I bet if you asked Amanda nicely she would hand it to you
12893,that's right did you go xxx did you go on an egg hunt last year
12894,he watched as his friends rode off without him
12895,you know who also grew up right here in New_York

12905,baby you wanna go in and sit with Amanda Honey while I talk to Luke
12906,that's right with Matt and Aunt Jill hid all sorts of yummy treats didn't she in the eggs
12907,when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
12908,you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to break it
12909,and their bird is the bluebird and their flower is the
12910,it was like seventy five minutes she liked fifteen of it
12911,come on said Simba I just heard about this great place
12912,I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say
12913,Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back
12914,do you remember what the big blue bug's name is
12915,alright Honey tell me which story you wanna read
12916,xxx uh oh oh my gosh Honey you're absolutely right
12917,they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
12918,Honey we can go out in a little bit but we have_to wait for our cookies
12919,I would imagine so you just ate a whole bunch of batter and chocolate chips
12920,that's true you guys found bunnies too
12921,there is no supermarket story in this one Sweetie Pie
12922,first thing to do is to prop up this tree
12923,ah you know what I'm gonna tell Amanda what you said the other morning
12924,and make it much stronger that has to be done
12925,oh is that the little library with the books in it
12926,prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a ship wreck was having a royal ball xxx
12927,okay so come in here and we'll make a tower out of blocks
12928,suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
12929,Sweetie why don't we color some of your princess papers that we can show Daddy later let's bring this over so we can lean on this you carry your box
12930,I said she woke up and I said
12931,Honey Honey if you have a stuffy nose you don't want to keep trying to breathe in
12932,you're right and the blue one's Bear's because Bear is big right
12933,do you remember what it's called the state that makes a lot of cheese
12934,um well you could probably pick a room on the inside of the house and put it in there
12935,well that's why you can put it on your back and it won't be heavy
12936,a trio of trespassers said the hyenas
12937,swim faster flounder she cried flounder raced to keep up
12938,and they're going to fix the xxx who's going to fix it
12939,this was literally she's still in her crib at six o'clock in the morning
12940,okay so the first big crack that we got extends out from under the refrigerator
12941,while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
12942,just as Ariel and flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
12943,in the back of the house if you turn the house around
12944,that's the actual little kernel of corn and then it pops open
12945,on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
12946,then carefully tenderly gently he crept
12947,and all the way over to the side of the wall
12948,Mommy can't wait for our library to open up so we can actually use it
12949,when they poked their heads out of the water Ariel and flounder saw colorful lights explode in the air above prince Eric's castle
12950,let's see we've got all your great princess pictures let's put them over here
12951,oh let's see if we know our letters
12952,I'm very disappointed in you Simba you deliberately disobeyed me he said
12953,Wisconsin has thousands of lakes that were formed by glaciers a long time ago
12954,I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
12955,you're gonna get a big bump on your nose if you blow it
12956,our library's been closed for like a year and a half
12957,I was just trying to be brave like you
12958,class I have some exciting news for you Miss Honey says
12959,and this state is famous for dairy products including cheese
12960,I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life said Ariel
12961,and he sat and he sat and he sat and he
12962,did you give it your best effort asked his mother

12978,yes I think you did and it got a little mushed
12979,yeah they put a big addition on but literally it just sat they sat doing nothing for so long and then all of a sudden like in the past month this whole building went up
12980,I'd like to be president too says Billy Dog
12981,so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
12982,off in the distance prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
12983,this isn't much fun the poor elephant grumbled
12984,shall I wake you up or would you like to sleep longer
12985,Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind
12986,um so I say so I said what do you want to eat
12987,I wish she'd come back because I'm cold and I'm wet
12988,he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life in the ship wreck
12989,spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country
12990,now Hilda and Billy don't forget to prepare your election campaign xxx
12991,do you know what they make in Alabama do you remember

12994,then we have middle fingers ring fingers and what's the little one
12995,I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them
12996,many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant
12997,but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach
12998,we're awake oh that was such a short nap
12999,I just had it at a friend's house last month
13000,riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
13001,Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king
13002,Honey I can't understand what you're saying is a Gummy_Bear something to eat
13003,it's kinda sweet it's kinda salty
13004,the following day Hilda sees Billy in the school yard
13005,Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw prince Eric
13006,the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
13007,I was like no Gummy_Bears are not something to eat in the morning
13008,it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
13009,hi Billy says Hilda whatever it is you're writing I'd be happy to help
13010,it's time for my surprise she said winking at flounder
13011,when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
13012,the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger
13013,do you think everything comes easily for them she asked
13014,swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and flounder hid behind it
13015,whoa Honey let's not knock it off onto the floor please
13016,your father has a marvelous surprise for you he said
13017,so we were supposed to go on a picnic with friends of ours this weekend
13018,and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself
13019,I thought reading books was your favorite thing
13020,these are my ideas and I don't want you to copy them
13021,Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeests directly towards Simba
13022,xxx hey I think Amanda has some work to do do you wanna sit on the other couch with me
13023,with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
13024,no that's why she's a lazy lazy bird
13025,Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
13026,okay Georgia is the largest state east of the Mississippi river
13027,I know Daisy is so heavy you were carrying her the other day
13028,I don't think the weather's supposed to be good at all
13029,copy them me never Hilda says I was just trying to be helpful
13030,so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away
13031,baby are you taking a nap with baby beluga
13032,well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they
13033,each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
13034,now if I'm extra nice to everybody at school they are sure to vote for me says Hilda
13035,I always thought when people were like yeah well we'll have to knock the tile out and redo it I'm like yeah but why is it cracking because you're going to put new tile down it's gonna happen again
13036,mhm where would you like me to put her
13037,they have peaches and peanuts and watermelon and the Okie_Fanokie swamp
13038,didn't we read that they were going to get a wildebeest in the zoo in our zoo
13039,no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
13040,baby ghost can read with us would that be good
13041,so to start my election campaign I will bake some nice tasty cookies
13042,easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again
13043,xxx we draw some things blue and some things we color
13044,it's called the Okie_Fanokie swamp is that a funny name
13045,but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze
13046,well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth
13047,I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
13048,did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday
13049,can you say the honey can you say can I help you
13050,but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
13051,can you bring it over here and I'll attach it for you again
13052,baby ghost which book would you like to read first
13053,what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we xxx
13054,I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
13055,he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge
13056,you know what that it's close to x that's a that's the last letter of the alphabet
13057,oh baby ghost wants to read Toot and Puddle first
13058,this color's the color of our dining room
13059,you gonna go find blankie and bring him home
13060,that's the real Billy Dog and that's the picture of him
13061,Nemo Nemo she's funny sometimes she does um she copies inflection
13062,suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
13063,yep one end of the Appalachian trail is in Georgia do you know how far it goes
13064,he's very faithful and he's taking care of that egg
13065,you know what I mean and sorta the intonation yyy sometimes
13066,but I caught you right you didn't really fall
13067,xxx when Puddle came into the kitchen for breakfast there was a note on the table
13068,climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
13069,okay let me put it back on for you
13070,you could hike up from Georgia let me show you the map from here I think all the way up to Maine
13071,Franklin remembered when Beaver when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater
13072,so some words that I'll say to her that I say kind of funny
13073,that is tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with fresh basil
13074,dear Puds gone for a walk be back soon Toot
13075,but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down
13076,P S I'll cut the grass when I get back
13077,it's easy said Franklin just do it
13078,okay let me go get the book then I'll come sit on the floor with you okay
13079,yes and you love cheese too so that's just delicious
13080,it was an accident said Scar I didn't mean for it to happen
13081,and then came the spring time with troubles anew
13082,Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water
13083,we had mozzarella and tomatoes last week when Manny brought us lots of yummy tomatoes right
13084,his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
13085,what am I going to do said Simba
13086,one morning Ariel the little mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend Flounder
13087,that's the poster a piece of paper with a picture of Billy Dog on it
13088,xxx at lunch time there was still no sign of Toot
13089,sometimes I'll say when we say hello I'll say hello
13090,run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
13091,but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
13092,they taunted and teased and they yelled how absurd
13093,maybe he went fishing said Tulip the bird
13094,Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
13095,Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father King Triton and all the other merpeople
13096,that's more for the violin though do you wanna play the violin
13097,would you like some you want me to get you some champagne crepes
13098,meanwhile Simba plodded across the savanna without any food or water
13099,Mississippi has the look of the old South with many Pre_Civil_War houses still standing
13100,they laughed and they laughed then they all ran away
13101,you do you have a lil pink teddy bear on your shirt
13102,and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun
13103,and they have a reminder don't forget to vote for me says Hilda
13104,well how would you go about asking for that water
13105,with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat
13106,dinner time came and Toot still wasn't back
13107,uh I don't think Flounder is a puffer+fish I think he's a different type of fish
13108,and Horton was lonely he wanted to play
13109,a big hearted wart+hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the young lion and he turned to his trusty pal a meerkat named Timon
13110,the Mississippi river forms the winding western border of the state
13111,ooh this is delicious said Tulip Toot would love it
13112,Amanda next time I have a sparkly barrette in the middle of my forehead you can tell me
13113,how's your campaigning coming along Lowly asks
13114,put you some water in this cup for you okay
13115,how do you say goodbye in spanish how do you say goodbye in spanish
13116,is very small and then when the puffer+fish gets scared or angry it xxx puffs up
13117,suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
13118,come on outside and I'll show you says Billy
13119,look you can go like this when you get a little bigger
13120,but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
13121,well I think they're going to go play but Horton's got_to take care of his little egg right
13122,should we make little red hearts on her shoes
13123,uh I guess it's near the front door Mommy's just looking
13124,are you nuts Pumbaa lions eat guys like us said Teemon Timon
13125,first these lunch tables need a new coat of paint
13126,you can't get lost in your own woods said Puddle
13127,xxx I put it in like two hours ago and I walked upstairs I'm like ah
13128,that is an e and an r again you're right
13129,she sang a song she had written just for Eric
13130,right do you remember what the puffer+fish name was in Nemo
13131,when it grew dark Puddle really began to worry
13132,djou remember how to say good morning is spanish
13133,people who come to Colorado enjoy skiing and hiking in the Rocky mountains
13134,well if we ask Mr Fix It to show us how we could paint them ourselves
13135,what if Toot tumbled into a hole and couldn't get out
13136,I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent
13137,hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
13138,well Rabbit's just hoping that Fox can hit the ball
13139,let me hold this until you get up on the couch
13140,xxx I think you know they're not as firm and sometimes you wanna put like some graham crackers or something in the crust to keep it
13141,it can't be he said I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
13142,just then Huckle sees Hilda what ideas do you have Hilda he calls
13143,no matter what happens this egg must be tended
13144,and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on
13145,but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
13146,still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song filling the night air
13147,but poor Horton's troubles were far far from ended
13148,well she says I've been so busy cooking I just haven't had time to think about it
13149,and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it
13150,oh my gosh that's a lotta popcorn in the mouth
13151,now you and I know the same exact amount of spanish
13152,for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind
13153,when the song was over Eric looked down across the sea
13154,okay okay I will sit but you hold your box and your map
13155,I'd better go search for him Puddle decided he's my best friend
13156,this is the way we clean up our toys
13157,three hunters came sneaking up softly behind
13158,mm homegrown vegetables taste delicious and you don't even need a garden
13159,he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
13160,what was that he asked did you hear something
13161,he heard the men's steps and turned with a start
13162,it's election day each member of the class puts their vote in a box to decide whether Hilda or Billy will become class president
13163,suddenly a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship
13164,Puddle walked all through the woods and around Pocket Pond and climbed to the top of Orchard Hill searching for his friend
13165,here you can find out how to grow tomatoes in pots
13166,right Rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow
13167,three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart
13168,who are you he called but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
13169,just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly
13170,you could also have a turkey sandwich or a ham sandwich
13171,djou want me to take your microphone out of the backpack and you can hold it
13172,they swam away very quickly Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where a shark couldn't reach them
13173,she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
13174,Pocahontas yes I think we need some brown for Pocahontas's outfit
13175,you want what you want some dried cherries Honey
13176,xxx well you have a funny way of thinking it's upside down
13177,they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
13178,I got it I think she's canadian I got it
13179,as shoe as soon as she was sure oh
13180,he held his head high and threw out his chest
13181,whatever could be keeping the dwarves said Snow White
13182,do you know what this beautiful place is called
13183,that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home
13184,yeah look did you mix your sprinkles into your dough Sweets
13185,he looked at the hunters as much as to say
13186,you can take the clip off you want me to hold the clip
13187,as my very first decision as class president I would like to ask Hilda to be our class vice president
13188,and they should be home from the diamond mine by now
13189,it's a really big park and you know who wants to go there
13190,beetles have hardened front wings that protect their delicate flying wings
13191,while she waited Snow White busied herself tidying up the cottage in the woods
13192,I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall
13193,yummy yummy yummy yummy
13194,what um what are you thinking of going back to school for
13195,I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
13196,I don't know why you like to look at the map upside down but you do
13197,I wonder if Nancy and Leanna are on the airplane already
13198,um that's another type that's called a devil's coach horse beetle
13199,Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
13200,mm prolly just some egg that's in your dough
13201,we got him at that little toy store on Hope Street
13202,Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up
13203,yeah do you remember what state they're flying to
13204,xxx Snow White he said come quickly a young deer is hurt in the woods
13205,well you can put that piece back into your bowl if you would like
13206,then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go
13207,xxx I don't know maybe the person who owns the store had an uncle Sig
13208,oh no cried Snow White the poor thing we must hurry
13209,he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
13210,mommy has to go pick her pants up today that were being shortened
13211,you're absolutely right they're going to California to see Leanna's grandparents
13212,but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with wide eyes
13213,or maybe it was just a funny name
13214,they soon reached a small clearing and everyone stood in a circle around the deer
13215,you want me to color or would you like to color
13216,and of course Leanna's mommy Nancy is going too
13217,it was such a perfect place to be that Puddle never wanted to go anywhere else
13218,finally he was riding his bike all by himself
13219,just the other day Toot was saying he hadn't flown anywhere in months
13220,do you know what the dwarves' names are
13221,you know what they're not at the tailor today remember when you went to that store with me and I was trying on the pants
13222,I'll throw that one away if you don't like it
13223,Toot on the other hand loved to take trips
13224,Franklin rode to the park to show his friends
13225,um beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere
13226,that was one place Toot had never been
13227,it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new
13228,he had been to Cape Cod the Grand Canyon and the Redwood Forests
13229,maybe you wanna read the rest of the Lion king book to yourself Honey
13230,don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just what we'll do
13231,I bet we could also try and make a picture out of these blocks maybe
13232,I guess he hadn't been to Provence is the country in France but Toot went to Paris in France in the last book didn't he
13233,Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed
13234,you need to pretend to eat it like the other one
13235,ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil
13236,djou want me to clip your little microphone to you and then you can just hold the box
13237,do you think for Liana's birthday we should get her a set of the vegetables Honey like this
13238,let's take him alive why he's terrible funny
13239,they were gonna shorten them at the store
13240,one day in January Toots decided to set off on his biggest trip ever
13241,this is going to be great because you know who likes apple pie
13242,did you tell did you tell xxx where your teacher Danielle is from Honey do you remember where Danielle's from
13243,not everything is as easy as it looks
13244,if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole
13245,remember and he loved art he saw the Mona Lisa in Paris
13246,and a I think that's an orange actually
13247,do you wanna come along he asked Puddle we could start with someplace warm and wild
13248,you think that would be good maybe we'll get a set for Liana for her birthday present
13249,Daddy likes apple pie too and also auntie likes apple pie
13250,it does but I can put the clip on if you want
13251,the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony
13252,do what am I doing Puddle asked himself now Tulip would be worried about him too
13253,and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on
13254,he is yawning because he's so tired
13255,it has a body of water in there but the xxx green one is Maryland
13256,I gotcha I think that's a little onion
13257,they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went
13258,a globe he's trying to figure out where he's going to go
13259,as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
13260,we have_to think about what we're gonna make for Thanksgiving dinner because who's coming
13261,which way would I go Puddle thought if I were Toot
13262,oh yeah great what do you think Pocahontas is doing outside
13263,um those little leaves maybe those are bay leaves
13264,they dug up his tree and put it inside with Horton so sad xxx
13265,he must be cold said Snow White covering the deer with her long cape
13266,and those are all the little baby turtles around
13267,I'm okay Hilda says but my tooth feels kinda funny
13268,dear Puddle I've made some new friends in Africa is winter getting boring love Toot
13269,even though he was a very small fish Flounder had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
13270,because she's outside near the trees what do you think she's doing
13271,well who's coming with Matthew he can't go all by himself right
13272,maybe he's just tired said Sleepy yawning
13273,didjou tell Manuela that we saw Evan at the park the other day remember we saw Evan
13274,bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers
13275,at home Hilda looks for something to make her feel better
13276,no those hunters are not so nice
13277,yes I can let me just cut your sandwich first
13278,Toot cried Puddle what are you doing here
13279,milk that's right do you think that's milk with a cookie
13280,you are right I do I like vanilla ice cream you're absolutely right
13281,I know when in pain ice is nice she says to herself
13282,I guess I got carried away Toot said I hopped on a train and then a bus and then a plane and then a bicycle and then one thing led to another all the way to Kookooposh
13283,most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time
13284,well nothing's wrong I'm just trying to
13285,as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen
13286,I don't know if we have all the pieces though so that makes it hard
13287,you know what this kind of shark is called
13288,Hilda lies down with an ice bag but her tooth is still sore
13289,well you could be right Sleepy said Snow White but xxx
13290,dear Puddle Egypt is awesome the pyramids are the greatest wish you could meet me at the oasis your friend Toot
13291,djou have a book about someone named Evan too
13292,do you want Mommy to get you something to eat Honey
13293,it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds
13294,which is funny because his head kinda looks like a hammer doesn't it
13295,maybe if I go to bed everything will be alright in the morning she decides
13296,we're off the men shouted and off they all went with Horton unhappy
13297,that's true I like to go for walks too
13298,well we read New_Hampshire should we read something else
13299,I am going to get some water for you
13300,the same way said Puddle I went looking for you and one thing just led to another all the way here
13301,twas the night before Thanksgiving and all through the nation
13302,I'm gonna put some graham crackers in this bag and I want you to break them up into little pieces okay
13303,Honey I think we're missing a couple of the blocks to make the picture
13304,should we read about Maine where's Maine on our map
13305,by the next day Hilda's cheek is so swollen she decides to wear a scarf to hide it
13306,xxx what's he oh yeah he's writing a letter but what is he riding
13307,maybe he has a hachoo a cold said Sneezy

13314,grandma the stone came from grandma and grandpa's gallery actually yeah
13315,that's just how whims are said Toot
13316,Maine Maine has many lighthouses to warn boats away from the rocky coast
13317,and I'm gonna seal it up and you know what you can do
13318,how sweet of you Lowly she says I love cookies
13319,xxx Flounder likes to go to the supermarket and eat raspberries
13320,isn't it exciting to be in such a far away place Toot asked
13321,well that's possible but he probably would've stayed in his thicket until he was feeling better said Snow White
13322,here's some water in your little baby cup yeah let me just get the phone xxx
13323,and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and
13324,you can just walk all over it or you can bang it with something
13325,Puddle wished Toot were there to taste the pancakes
13326,you know what we may Sweetie what we may do later
13327,Tulip will be worried now that we're both xxx missing said Puddle
13328,gee have you seen your cheek Hilda it's swollen

13333,hey Sweetie pie do you remember the names of some of the planets
13334,okay let's see what do we have that you can bang it with
13335,then out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
13336,I'm sure that would help Happy but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song
13337,it occurred to me after I left a message that he wasn't there
13338,xxx we don't need to get beetles at the mall but we hafta get you socks you need socks at the mall
13339,dear Puddle can you believe I'm in the Solomon Islands
13340,right you're right he looks a little bit blue too but they call him a great white shark
13341,at night we were nestled all snug in our beds
13342,after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping they would not be too late for her father's concert
13343,um because we don't want to hurt the floor or anything right
13344,so sometimes they're a little orange and yellow and red
13345,they're in the Pacific Ocean I spend all day underwater I love being in a school of fish
13346,have a seat Hilda Dr Rabbit will see you in a minute

13351,oh there's one pooping and one not pooping
13352,and the third one is the one we live on do you remember where we live
13353,and the very next morning Thanksgiving yippee we got up and watched the parade on tv
13354,I'm so frightened Lowly I hope Dr Rabbit won't have_to use the tooth drill on me
13355,but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter
13356,Tulip will be worried now that we're both mithing missing said Puddle I'd better give her a jingle
13357,this is not something to get worked up over
13358,my sister in law was telling me the other
13359,Mommy's eating edges of your hummus sandwich
13360,yes spring had arrived and Puddle was having mud season
13361,did you learn anything exciting about bugs while I was gone
13362,what if you listen to music while Dr Rabbit works then you won't hear the drill
13363,we all feel shy sometimes don't we Bashful said Snow White
13364,are you gonna watch the parade with Matthew this year on tv

13366,then the next one is a little planet called Mars
13367,I found him Puddle said we're fine we'll be back soon
13368,and Horton said day after day after day I meant what I said and I said what I meant but oh am I
13369,then Dopey started pacing back and forth and pointing over his shoulder
13370,it's time for your appointment Hilda Miss Molar says I'll be back with a radio as fast as I can Hilda says Lowly
13371,it's a surprise your microphone is waiting for you
13372,did you find did you learn that let's see

13376,I'll get you another graham cracker if you want Sweets
13377,she has a top my nephew is Lily's age and they have a baby who's born in April
13378,they have the highest mountain in the world there Toot said
13379,okay would you like to color some of the ground or the rocks or would you like to do a new princess

13382,xxx and Mommy and Auntie when they were little but it was really Grandma xxx cat
13383,first we'll take a picture before Dr Rabbit sees you

13385,are you sure this is a good idea asked Puddle
13386,you could djou wanna carry your microphone or or do you want your backpack on which one
13387,and he is so not happy with his younger sister
13388,I don't know which face you're talking about
13389,the wicked queen probably cast a spell on him
13390,their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects
13391,oh I'm sure and they got back on an airplane
13392,or the water there's water there if you wanna color the water in blue would you like to do that
13393,back at Woodcock Pocket for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow that nobody can deny
13394,ha ha it's not a photograph it's an x_ray picture of the inside of your mouth says Miss Molar
13395,and then that's the napkin and then that's a little turkey napkin ring
13396,phew puffed Puddle that was fun he said when they got_to the top of the mountain
13397,you have a choice carry your box or wear your mike or wear your backpack
13398,you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun
13399,and then the little one is his lucky fin
13400,suddenly Doc pushed his way past the others and approached the deer
13401,do you remember the names of Jupiter's moons some of his moons
13402,should we put the blocks back in the basket
13403,right she's gonna put it down next to the plate right

13405,butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers
13406,I'm glad we did it together said Puddle
13407,do the face for me and then I'll do it
13408,I know that's the neatest backpack I've ever seen
13409,and every time my sister was holding the baby he's
13410,I mean take a look he said adjusting his eye glasses
13411,well Hilda one of your teeth is infected but it will be as good as new after I take care of it
13412,as they hiked down the mountain Puddle was quiet
13413,dear Puddle help mountain climbing is scarier than jumping out of a plane remember when I talked you in to going parachuting your friend in the Alps Toot
13414,okay come closer to mommy you hold the box okay
13415,what does she have in her hair I guess it looks like a funny headband hm
13416,and set the two tables with patience and care
13417,what's wrong Toot asked are you getting pooped out
13418,and I'll clip this so you don't have_to carry it
13419,Simba stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
13420,the turkey went in and as more cousins came I laughed and I shouted and I called them by name
13421,all ashore the men shouted and down with a lurch
13422,um I don't know maybe it's a funny kind of shell
13423,you look at the book while I get the chocolate milk okay
13424,what color is you know what sweetie+pie can you go to the table on top of your Maisy puzzles the poster

13426,terrific just like mommy look see mommy has her's clipped and she holds her box
13427,this is the way we clean up the blocks

13430,yeah you do you got a little rip on Gil you're right
13431,and one night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago
13432,that's a goat that's right a mountain
13433,Doc gently removed the sharp thorn and the deer jumped up and licked him
13434,the only face I'm gonna make when you throw it at me is a mad face
13435,actually several of the planets have rings but I always think of Saturn
13436,tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him
13437,sitting on the couch and she said he just came charging at her
13438,a damp shady place that's where they like
13439,mhm that kind of picture is called an x_ray

13453,the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
13454,the deer licked Snow White's hand and ran into the forest

13456,and she put her hand out and then he just like fell over
13457,xxx has lots_of fur standing with a duck it's a doggie
13458,Simba came to his rescue but after wrestling with the lioness who easily flipped him on his back he realized she was his old friend Nala

13510,dear Pudsy bonjour from Paris art is everywhere and love is in the air au_revoir Toot
13511,we played with my toys and computer games too
13512,Kentucky has the Mammoth caves it's the largest cave system in the world
13513,Hilda likes the music so much she forgets about the dentist's drill
13514,you know Sweets let's put this on the table instead of the couch because I don't wanna get Playdoh stuck all over the couch okay
13515,I'm so proud of each and every one of you
13516,encouraged by his father's words Simba returned to Pride rock
13517,poor Horton grew sadder the farther he went
13518,um that's the angler+fish but his light ended up over here see
13519,when he arrived he found the land bare and dry
13520,I'm gonna go around the other side okay
13521,but he said as he sat in that hot noisy tent
13522,what's that very tall building in Paris that you have the picture of in your school
13523,I don't know if the cat likes to be dressed up in clothes
13524,Kentucky is called the Bluegrass state and was nicknamed for its blue green grass
13525,here's his light maybe we can get it out
13526,the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
13527,I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent
13528,late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
13529,that's a great pink see there's a flower you wanna color that pink
13530,see and this little blue one here is Earth where we live
13531,I'm the king said Scar if you were half the king Mufasa was I'm ten times the king Mufasa was
13532,open your mouth as wide as you can says Dr Rabbit
13533,presumed innocent I think Don gave to someone but it's one of the best mystery books that I've read I read it in college actually and I liked it
13534,you wanna read your underwater under the ocean book
13535,we don't want Playdoh stuck all over the floor do we
13536,you don't wanna take it off and put it with him
13537,as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
13538,that's how the Earth is and look at how big Jupiter is it's huge
13539,the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not so far from
13540,xxx wow that was a lotta little tiny things wasn't it
13541,it's a tower not this shirt a different shirt
13542,that night Snow White and the seven dwarves made a delicious dinner
13543,xxx a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
13544,suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
13545,what kind of cake are you gonna make
13546,xxx it's a little yucky but it's neat too
13547,now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
13548,the Eiffel Tower's in Paris that's right
13549,Hilda likes the music so much she forgets about the dentist's drill
13550,then when they had all had their fill they sang and dances until it was time for bed
13551,we made Pilgrim hats and funny shoe buckles then put on a skit
13552,I'm a little surprised to see you alive Simba
13553,I think he's just called the angler+fish but let me look and see if I can clarify that
13554,but we're gonna learn about all those okay
13555,Sweetie would you rather have me pick a book we haven't read in a while
13556,give me one good reason I shouldn't rip you apart Scar
13557,well you could touch some that's true I guess
13558,these include the planets one of which is Earth where we live
13559,and dawdling a long way up high in the sky who of all people should chance to fly by but that old good for nothing bird runaway Maisy
13560,Corduroy waited patiently then he suddenly perked up his ears
13561,but Scar forced Simba to say in front of all the lions that he had caused his father's death
13562,thank you for fixing my tooth Dr Rabbit it didn't hurt a bit
13563,snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain
13564,okay let me look and see if I can find if he has a name
13565,Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
13566,that's a little she's sitting on a cushion on a little chair and it has little tassles on it
13567,and thank you for the music Lowly she adds you always have the best ideas
13568,oh Simba you're in trouble again but this time daddy isn't here to save you and everyone knows why
13569,the solar system was once a cloud of dust and gas that stretched for more than a trillion miles
13570,dearest Pudzio Italy is heaven it's one big treat your friend Tootzio
13571,one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor gardens Mrs Brown thought she would take him out shopping
13572,you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
13573,sure I use scissors for lots_of things but we have_to be careful with scissors right
13574,that's a snail he's on top of a banana
13575,okay don't forget your box honey which is right here
13576,about five billion years ago a nearby star exploded sending shockwaves through the cloud
13577,people had come from near and far to celebrate
13578,and spying the flags on the tents just below she
13579,we're going to the Portobello Road explained Judy
13580,and Simba ran after him Scar pleaded with his nephew
13581,oh and little tulips too I didn't even notice that
13582,I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
13583,what else can we read about what other state should we read about
13584,the cloud the cloud became a slow turning disk and the disk's center shrank and became the Sun
13585,it had been the largest wedding in the history of Agraba
13586,Jupiter's so big it has a big ret red spot on it right
13587,in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime
13588,meanwhile it was Halloween in Woodcock Pocket and Puddle decided to be horrifying ah he's a monster
13589,you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan there's a lot to see
13590,look says Billy Dog someone's moving into the old haunted house
13591,now Aladdin and Jasmine were preparing to take a trip far far away
13592,and I'll make it really big so that we have enough space for our crocodile
13593,first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash+cloths but nothing was the right size or color
13594,she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door good gracious gasped Maisy I've seen you before
13595,our solar system is made up of a star which we call the sun and a group of planets that travel around it
13596,limping badly Simba climbed to the top of pride rock and let out a magnificent roar as he looked out over his kingdom
13597,other particles from the cloud stuck together and formed planets which travel in roughly circular orbits around the Sun
13598,Daddy takes the train and where does he take the train
13599,most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots
13600,whoever it is must be pretty brave to live there says Hilda
13601,do you remember that I told you that Mommy and Daddy went to Portobello Road and bought something
13602,would you like to come into the kitchen with me
13603,Abu stay out of those bags warned Aladdin smiling at his curious little friend
13604,then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
13605,poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk
13606,planets near the Sun are small and rocky
13607,there are also moons asteroids and comets
13608,we made Pilgrim hats and funny shoe buckles then put on a skit for the aunts and the uncles
13609,before long Pride rock flourished again Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had they had their own newborn cub
13610,there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
13611,do you remember what it was that we bought
13612,I know you don't like to eat the kernels it's true
13613,if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures
13614,the sun is more than a million times larger than Earth
13615,those farther away are larger and made mostly of gas
13616,Jasmine's going to be so surprised when she sees what I've planned
13617,you know the there's a little picture above your armoire in your room
13618,you know what actually your half birthday's in just a couple days
13619,without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
13620,there rang out the noisiest ear+splitting squeaks from the egg that he'd sat on for fifty one weeks
13621,it is a huge ball of hydrogen and helium gases

13666,Mercury's surface is filled with craters made by space rocks
13667,Mommy might have_to make some tea for herself so she doesn't cough okay

13669,it's my egg she sputtered you stole it from me get off of my nest and get out of my tree
13670,so Puddle's sweeping and cooking and cleaning and brushing his teeth
13671,I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
13672,let's get going said Jasmine I can't wait
13673,interesting mystery also interesting commentary just on like black white relations in
13674,one day in January Toot decided to set off on his biggest trip ever
13675,and you know what the teacher's name is
13676,we saw seaweed when we went to the beach with Tamara didn't we
13677,you're gonna grow up to be big and strong
13678,Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
13679,oh a little walrus look at that little guy he's cute
13680,you're right you're right there are little tiny peppers inside the olives that we call pimientos
13681,Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
13682,he's bringing flowers pretty flowers to the table
13683,yep cobwebs and spider webs are the same thing
13684,then they took off soaring high above the palace
13685,it's closer to the Sun than any other planet and travels around the Sun in only eighty eight Earth days
13686,suddenly they turned a corner and Paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world
13687,as far as we know Earth is the only planet that has life on it
13688,it takes place in Maryland it's really good
13689,Jasmine laughed with delight the wind blowing her long hair behind her
13690,what other book do you wanna read Sweetie do you wanna go pick one out from the basket
13691,December called for celebration here's to all your adventures around the world said Puddle
13692,a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people
13693,wow Earth's center is made of solid and melted metal
13694,I read that really quickly too and it's um
13695,and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg that he'd sat on so long and so well
13696,Mercury's surface is filled with craters made by space rocks that crashed on to its surface
13697,as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag a very bad Corduroy had discovered
13698,oh xxx thanks for being the best little girl ever
13699,do you remember we saw stingrays at the aquarium
13700,here's to all you adventures right at home said Toot
13701,cone shells prickly cockle shells spider conch
13702,after a little while the magic carpet began its descent
13703,and here's to being together again Toot and Puddle said at the same time
13704,his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
13705,he's watching tv who likes to watch tv
13706,it had ears and a tail and a trunk
13707,before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
13708,the planet has a very thin atmosphere and temperatures can rise
13709,while dinner was cooking we played dodgeball outside
13710,Toot was happy to be back in his own bed and Puddle was happy too
13711,one store was even having its picture taken
13712,let's see what else what other state should we read about
13713,and you went to the the aquarium one day with Daddy all by yourself just you and Daddy
13714,close your eyes I want this to be a surprise
13715,our tummies were growling can we eat yet we cried
13716,that's a new supermarket said Judy there must be something special going on there
13717,and the people came shouting what's all this about and they looked and they stared with their eyes popping out
13718,the timer then sounded the turkey was cooked
13719,suddenly the magic carpet landed on top of a high cliff and Jasmine heard a noise that sounded like crashing water
13720,I wonder if it will snow all night Puddle said
13721,there are lots_of things you can do with the treasures you have collected from the beach
13722,Mommy's a little bit bigger that's true
13723,hah fly is it a fly or I thought it was a fly but the woman at the store told me it was a bee
13724,Mom opened the oven she sniffed and she looked
13725,but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
13726,did I tell you Lily and I went I had to go by a couple of bras the other day and Lily goes with me we're in the dressing room and she says to me you're naked
13727,it brings the sun it brings the heat it brings the things we like to eat
13728,Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass
13729,and they cheered and they cheered and they cheered more and more
13730,inside the house the movers are busy setting up furniture
13731,perhaps I could do some shopping for you Mrs Brown he asked hopefully
13732,how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
13733,you know what this is actually the surface of the moon and they're looking at Earth
13734,someone collected rocks and then painted pretty pictures on them
13735,look Billy says that must be our new neighbor standing at the door
13736,but it can be hundreds of degrees below zero during the long nights
13737,Mrs Brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
13738,uh no I'm sorry he's not in may I take a message
13739,summer brings so many things it brings us things to do outside it brings new ways to take a ride
13740,would you like to read some books Honey
13741,Jasmine couldn't believe her eyes she'd never seen anything so beautiful
13742,well now they're painted very pretty painted rocks
13743,well we did remember we looked at all those little fruits and veggies that they that they
13744,she's kind of spooky looking Hilda says
13745,he really likes to watch tv what does he like to watch on tv
13746,did your other Ariel go swimming in your pool
13747,the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
13748,the water was a brilliant shade of turquoise and dolphins leapt in and out of the water as if they were dancing
13749,oh yuck honey is that old Play_Doh we ha havta throw that away
13750,but Jonathan told her not to worry even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
13751,when I go up to pay for it Lily goes what color's your bras
13752,you do love Frog and Toad you're right that is one of your favorites
13753,that house down there has a rock with numbers painted on it
13754,hey what is she doing outside Billy says
13755,the stuffing was fluffy thanks to Aunt Lucy
13756,we like to ride way out of town we like to ride uphill and down
13757,here go why don't you show Amanda your bracelet tell her who's on there
13758,he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
13759,Venus is about the same size as the Earth but would not be pleasant to visit
13760,Dad slid out the bird it weighed thirty pounds
13761,huge ocean waves crashed onto a white sandy beach
13762,and it should be it should be it should be like that because Horton was faithful he sat and he sat he meant what he said and he said what he meant and they sent him home
13763,it's like that only they painted flowers and things on these rocks
13764,right and what did you get at the aquarium when you went with Mommy
13765,okay would you like to pick it out or do you want Mommy to pick it out
13766,ah the children run away as fast as they can
13767,we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added Judy
13768,it feels so good when we go fast we like to feel the breeze go past
13769,he turned and he tripped over one of our hounds
13770,Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
13771,you're supposed to tell them without showing them
13772,Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
13773,this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
13774,many different foods and drinks are made from plants
13775,right and what do you say when you watch football with Daddy
13776,click click that's right that's what a dolphin says very good Sweets
13777,and she's like what color's your underpants
13778,he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted Mrs Brown's shopping list
13779,there's a little car that was riding on Mars and took pictures of it
13780,we see the ocean when we were with Tamar and Rafi on the beach
13781,fruit and vegetables come from plants but so do other everyday foods such as flour coffee cocoa oil and sugar
13782,we ride and ride about a mile and then we stop and eat a while
13783,I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
13784,oh my gosh the turkey's flying in the air
13785,huh that's a good question I guess xxx maybe kinda like a seal like a kinda funny xxx
13786,that's right and did you see the sea lion show with Mommy and Daddy
13787,you know what I had old G R Es that I had taken because I had previously applied to graduate school in New York
13788,dear Puddle I've made some new friends in Africa
13789,hey Lily I just found another one of your blocks
13790,everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
13791,finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
13792,xxx cocoa comes from a plant Honey do you know what cocoa makes
13793,we like cold things we eat them up and when we eat so does our pup
13794,the woman at the register was like oh boy
13795,uh huh do you remember the names of any of the sea lions
13796,there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
13797,this is where the asteroid which is like a big rock landed on the Earth and made that huge crater
13798,and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
13799,he could certainly see why it was called a super market
13800,what was the big sea lion's name that you liked
13801,it just looks tiny in the picture next to the planet
13802,of course I didn't go so I had them to submit already thankfully
13803,all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
13804,most plant foods are grown as crops and are picked or harvested in the summer
13805,xxx who ate ice cream yesterday at the ice cream store
13806,actually this was a really interesting book that I just read
13807,look there she is again with a cauldron and a broomstick Hilda explains exclaims
13808,the atmosphere is so dense on Venus you would feel like you were under water
13809,oh this one that's what a friend is
13810,Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
13811,my brother and I made such a clatter as we leapt and caught the bird on a platter
13812,I once read that witches use cauldrons and broomsticks broomsticks now I know she's a witch
13813,Nick Londain have you heard of that it's just about a woman a journalist
13814,you did do you remember what kind of ice cream you had
13815,what kind of birds were we chasing on the beach
13816,look for combine harvesters working in the fields late in the summer
13817,that's true we do have_to get some drinks don't we we have_to get some juice and some milk
13818,I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
13819,Puddle wished Toot were there to taste the pancakes
13820,I don't think we have_to be so grabby
13821,yeah there's nothing to make you feel stupid like a standardized test
13822,where's my look the other block look behind your pirate ship
13823,it seems to me he should have his name someplace
13824,these huge machines harvest crops such as wheat oats rye and barley
13825,do you remember when we went to Vermont Honey and we saw where they made that cheese and maple syrup
13826,well it's very exciting that school's going to start soon isn't it
13827,what else do you like to get at the supermarket
13828,oh thanks we don't have any tissues left
13829,can't you see that these people are starving
13830,yes you probably need help getting down there
13831,I'm like every time I've ever taken like my S A Ts my G R Es everything I'm like I'm an English major and my math always ends up higher than my English which is not to say my math is astronomically high but I'm like what happened
13832,cookies that's right we call that one cookies and cream
13833,Dad spoke not a word but went straight to his work
13834,that are grown for their seeds or grain
13835,who takes minimum wage jobs in three different areas of the country to see like if it's doable if you could live on your own on minimum wage
13836,if you were on Venus you would feel like you were under water
13837,excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket
13838,as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
13839,and who are you going to see at school
13840,Jupiter is a very different planet from the other planets near the sun
13841,combine harvesters don't just cut they crop they also gather it together and separate the grain from the stalk
13842,and we got_to taste all that cheese and the maple syrup with the little tiny spoons
13843,he sliced up the turkey and turned with a jerk
13844,would you like to color in some of Belle's yellow dress
13845,there was one more but I can't remember was his name Surfer or no
13846,mm no I think Gabi had pink didn't she
13847,in front of our house we heard beeps of a horn
13848,as far as we know Earth is the only planet that has life
13849,he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
13850,is that fire truck gonna put out a fire
13851,mm really I don't think you actually ate the sandwich
13852,the grain is ground into flour or used to make bread or breakfast cereal
13853,yeah and did we go to the library with Tamar
13854,it was a big like a big rock that fell from the sky
13855,and pay your rent it's very interesting actually
13856,the piano that's right that's what it is
13857,his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels
13858,I don't remember we'll hafta ask Daddy see if he remembers
13859,with a wink of his eye and a twist of his head the party can start I made it Norm said
13860,oh you know what they look just like the black_eyed_susans it's hard to tell in this picture but those are sunflowers
13861,they had a wonderful time swimming and enjoying the sun and
13862,I know and I think they changed the format now actually because when I took it
13863,we all took our places the food smelled so great
13864,he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
13865,oh no here she comes Hilda said she must have seen me spying on her
13866,whoa whoa whoa Lily's a tornado whoa whoa whoa
13867,we like the things that summer brings it brings us
13868,when he and Jasmine were ready to go Aladdin snapped his fingers
13869,we started to dig in but Dad said to wait
13870,this was actually a good this is a novel miracle life of Edgar Mint I like that one
13871,may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
13872,do I have any peas for our chicken pot pie

13874,I'd better leave before she puts a spell on me
13875,we're thankful that everyone is together this year
13876,you can take as much as you want now he continued
13877,in our home and our hearts where we hold you so dear
13878,once again Aladdin asked Jasmine to cover her eyes as they descended Jasmine felt the air grow colder
13879,it used to be math verbal and analytical but I think it's different now isn't it
13880,that's good oh why don't you take this if you're interesting in reading it please my god
13881,I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
13882,oh_my_goodness gracious you're all caught up in your microphone here
13883,the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy
13884,what else are we gonna put in there
13885,he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
13886,what does a witch do with a cauldron asked Billy
13887,I don't know it kinda looks like Bloat a little bit but maybe not so much
13888,can you tell them yeah tell me what they are
13889,xxx oh I don't know I think it might be your little box
13890,oh that's a good idea they kind of look like little Playdoh teeth
13891,in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
13892,jelly we saw a big thing of jellyfish didn't we
13893,I bet she's going to cook up some secret potion for her magic spell says Hilda
13894,what happened to all your little blue things that go in here
13895,we ate and we ate yet last but not least
13896,what is it Jasmine asked bending down to touch the cold white powder
13897,the more Paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked
13898,in some countries with warm climates sunflowers are grown as a crop
13899,some summer days we take a ride the car gets very hot inside
13900,do you remember what you used to call Pooh bear when you were a little girl
13901,but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
13902,he felt sure Mrs Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
13903,it's snow answered Aladdin isn't it wonderful
13904,the children decide to follow her back to the house
13905,are we gonna make cranberry sauce for our Thanksgiving dinner
13906,and when we sit in all that heat we wish that we had used our feet
13907,lemme look in the kitchen see if I put in the kitchen okay
13908,I hope she didn't see us following her Hilda says
13909,yes spring had arrived and Puddle was having mud season
13910,maybe Raffi let's see if I have any Raffi down here
13911,next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
13912,a friend is a listener who will always be there when you've got a big secret you just hafta share
13913,in nineteen sixty nine human astronauts landed on the Moon's surface for the first time
13914,oh he loves the color blue so he likes blueberries I see
13915,wow and the four largest were discovered four hundred years ago
13916,it's amazing cried Jasmine it looks like a soft white cloud
13917,perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady
13918,the sunflower seeds are harvested and used to make cooking oil
13919,you know what mommy has to do excuse mommy for just one second
13920,there she is again she's following us
13921,watch out she called Abu had thrown a snowball and it was headed straight for Aladdin
13922,the astronauts could see the Earth shining in Moon in the Moon's black daytime sky
13923,a friend is a sidekick who'll sit by your side to make you feel better when you're troubled inside
13924,hi Puds am I in India or is this a dream
13925,well we saw lots_of different colored fish I think
13926,I have_to run to the freezer and defrost the fish for tonight
13927,it is djou recognize any of the letters djou know what they are
13928,but we don't mind linen this hot cold water cools us off a lot
13929,and some green beans or some sugar snap peas or something like that would be fun
13930,she is wearing some glasses you're right
13931,there's Europa which has the smoothest surface of any planet or moon
13932,we shouldn't be going into someone's house without their permission Lowly says
13933,corn is a tall leafy plant grown for its plump yellow cobs of grain
13934,it's your birthday May third hope your party is the best
13935,they spent the rest of the day playing in the snow and built snow+men and made snow+angels
13936,because the Moon's atmosphere is very thin its sky remains black even when the sun shines
13937,it cools us off down to our toes our pup is going to cool his nose
13938,and when there's nothing to do on a wet rainy day a friend is a pal who'll come over to play
13939,Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
13940,yeah those are jelly beans we're not eating those now Honey
13941,but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddinton with interest
13942,and uh what other fruit doesn't Daddy like another fruit that looks sort of like a honeydew but it's orange
13943,yo there she is again screams Hilda but we just saw her outside
13944,they even used the magic carpet as a sled to slide down a nearby hill
13945,most corn is grown for animal feed but it also
13946,summer brings so many things summer brings us rides on swings
13947,since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
13948,xxx for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow
13949,Mars has long been called the Red Planet
13950,and there's Ganymede which is the largest moon in the solar system
13951,friends are just perfect for all kinds of things
13952,ah she's not one she's two witches
13953,we swing up high into the trees we swing so fast we make a breeze
13954,soon the sun began to set and the air grew tolder colder
13955,like walking or talking or swinging on swings

14294,that's true Daddy does like plain feta but he doesn't like olives
14295,Franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big fat raindrops began to fall
14296,that's a pot that's hanging up to cook with
14297,the story you sure know all the titles don't you
14298,remember when Sleeping beauty was dancing with the Prince at the end
14299,and one man reads in the tub while a cat watches
14300,but I can show you and you can do it yourself
14301,one woman sits in the bubbles and sings
14302,those are ants they're trying to eat the cake
14303,he's gonna take it off is she going to cook something
14304,one day in summer Frog was not feeling well
14305,you know what Honey Mommy's just gonna make some tea okay
14306,I don't think Daddy does like plain olives I don't think Daddy likes olives
14307,because Toot and Puddle are friends and then um Toot gets to go traveling too and that's fun
14308,okay the buttons go out so you can see them yep
14309,oh that'll be good timing because it's not like right then you know
14310,oh Frog you are looking quite green said Toad
14311,no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree+house where it was dry
14312,to telescopes on Earth Uranus looks like a small green disk without any surface features
14313,but I always look green said Frog I'm a frog
14314,whaddya think she's gonna cook
14315,and in the other book right Toot and Puddle go traveling together because they both go to France
14316,summer brings new games to play in summertime we play croquet
14317,do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree+house when it's a thunder storm
14318,it is twenty times farther away from the Sun than Earth and it spins on its side
14319,how are we going to get those eggs off those lily+pads
14320,what was the place in France that they went to
14321,are you getting very sticky with that candy Honey
14322,yay xxx we'll hafta see I heard it was supposed to rain tomorrow
14323,they might be a little big for the door but your sleeping beauty key chain fit in so beautifully into the door
14324,but beneath its deep atmosphere is a giant ocean of liquid or icy water
14325,fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree
14326,deep under the ocean there may still be a rocky center
14327,ooh buddy whoa now I'm all tangled up in your thing
14328,can you find something in backpack that will help us scoop up those eggs
14329,well but see Amanda needs to know what you're saying and she can hear you through the microphone
14330,she likes to go to bed with her pink fuzzy slippers
14331,the cat family is watching television at home when suddenly the picture changes
14332,xxx I hope that man's going to fix it

14334,doop_doop_a_doop_a_doop is there a ring walking on my leg
14335,fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said
14336,who's got a little dirty chin
14337,I also spoke to Jill who said it's pouring there today
14338,look Huckle it's Hilda Lowly says what is she doing on tv

14346,lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt

14348,oh_my_goodness when is Mommy going to get rid of this cold
14349,and waves come up they come up fast sometimes our sand house does not last
14350,I think it'd be a great idea if we actually went to sleep tonight and stayed asleep all night
14351,it's kind of like glasses but only one side instead of two
14352,wow look at the prizes that were inside the eggs
14353,xxx there's your box do you want me to get Ariel baby Ariel
14354,but there is lots_of sand to dig to make another just as big
14355,when oh I know do you think I have_to go to the doctor
14356,Franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig_zag light
14357,they use big towels and little towels and a lot of dusting powder
14358,do you wanna go to the toy store and buy toys after
14359,what are you gonna do in the pillows
14360,in the meantime Hilda is pretending that she is a princess learning how to cook
14361,when we go out on summer nights we see the fireflies with their lights
14362,all the men shave except for three who have beards
14363,um we're actually still doing her Brown thing you're being taped
14364,do you remember what Trevor's gonna be for Halloween tonight

14375,to go to sleep and stay asleep until the sun comes out
14376,right and do you remember what Phoebe's gonna be
14377,then when the one hundred and five people are showered and bathed shaved and toweled dusted and dried they put on their underwear
14378,but Franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still Franklin wouldn't come out
14379,yeah every day is a dark day on Pluto because the Sun is so far away
14380,we let the fireflies go away the moon is out it lights our way
14381,Mommy is actually also gonna call your doctor to see if they have any more flu vaccines for you
14382,the next morning at school everyone wants to congratulate the new tv star
14383,you're just about the silliest little girl I ever knew
14384,we hear the horse go clop clop clop our pup goes fast asleep on top
14385,Franklin's friends begged him to play but Franklin stayed put
14386,it can only be seen with a powerful telescope because it is both the most distant planet in our solar system and the smallest planet
14387,well now it's out you're absolutely right

14410,we hafta go through your drawers and take out some clothes that are too small on you
14411,did you bring your teacher a present yesterday

14413,but you know you have a couple different maps so it might be pink on one map
14414,no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling
14415,this is a long one do you wanna read a shorter one

14419,Franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked
14420,yeah he does look like he needs a trim doesn't he
14421,but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
14422,okay we're just about to put our little pies in the oven

14424,where's our big grey xxx uh pot that goes on top of the

14426,I'm going to go blow my nose until it falls off
14427,oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off
14428,they are giving them to themselves trims right
14429,I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad
14430,it's like you're walking a dog on a leash
14431,sighed Maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg I'm tired and I'm bored and I've kinks in my
14432,and then we can put some of your new clothes into your drawers for school
14433,you think if I keep blowing my nose my nose will fall off
14434,fox smiled I think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers
14435,oh careful gosh your puppy just jumped into the cube
14436,well ya know the big grey one that used to sit on top of here
14437,from sitting just sitting here day after day it's work how I hate it I'd much rather
14438,Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time
14439,giants that's ridiculous said beaver Mister_Owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground
14440,and it's making a very funny noise
14441,she's from the same place with the Eiffel tower right
14442,aw we forgot to tell Daddy that you slipped and fell on a wet floor today
14443,well he's a monster so he looks a little different
14444,but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
14445,yeah some of the men wear teeshirt undershirts with sleeves and some with undershirts without sleeves
14446,you have_to be very gentle because the box is fragile
14447,I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest if I could find someone to stay on my
14448,yeah but where's the big grey one no it's not on the table
14449,the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder
14450,can you find the path that leads to the farm
14451,then Toad went into the house and stood on his head
14452,it's making very very funny noises at me
14453,and a few of the ninety two do not wear undershirts at all
14454,I think you were playing with it where did it go
14455,why are you standing on your head asked Frog
14456,that was just a little bit scary but you're okay right
14457,well you know what I already have some that are cut and I think you might like them so let's see
14458,I have one thank you very much it's in my mouth
14459,the night and the temperature are falling and one thin man buttons up a suit of long sleeve long legged underwear
14460,I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
14461,Franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends
14462,and from now on we hafta be careful to keep the floors dry so you don't slip right
14463,okay we'll stop later at the supermarket to get more bread for toast
14464,soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped
14465,hello called the lazy bird smiling her best you've nothing to do and I do need a rest
14466,xxx oh you seem to think that you know things are upside down
14467,all of the men put on black socks
14468,okay well then Mommy will get it without you or something
14469,but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
14470,then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play
14471,would you like to sit on the egg in my nest
14472,there are short socks and long socks and fancy silk socks and that have decorations called clocks
14473,maybe a bite of foot will make me feel better
14474,then Toad poured a glass of water over his head
14475,but I know you have a tendency to like it the other way
14476,Engo and Rumi are the two dogs that live across the street and Nancy is the woman who lives across the street with the two dogs
14477,okay now I'm gonna pour this in here
14478,because Grandma Barbara and Grandpa Richard are coming later right
14479,the elephant laughed why of all silly things I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
14480,heehee are you turning that light on and off
14481,and then you are going to whisk it okay
14482,I know why the storm is over Franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it
14483,I think this one's okay we'll have_to see
14484,why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog
14485,that's your soap eraser I know Mommy thought it was a bar of soap
14486,but it's it's feeling pretty good right now
14487,me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small mam and I am so
14488,I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
14489,does kinda look like a bar of soap doesn't it
14490,some of the men wear leg garters to keep their long socks from falling down around their ankles
14491,yay it tastes so good it tastes like olives and feta
14492,right you got_to play with the jellyfish at the beach the other day didn't you
14493,Honey why don't you take your shoes off if we're gonna climb on the couch okay
14494,tut tut answered Maisy I know you're not small but I'm sure you can do it no trouble
14495,Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story
14496,Tico says there's one more egg to find at the farm
14497,hee hee I think they're supposed to be white and brown
14498,the man with the long beard has a whole in his sock I think
14499,normally we don't play with jellyfish because they could sting us but that kind didn't have any tentacles and couldn't sting you so it was great
14500,oh my gosh is he standing on his head
14501,just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind come be a good fellow I know you
14502,and do you put her hair into a you pull her hair back
14503,think that's got some sugar and cinnamon on it
14504,because I've never eaten a blue or a pink egg have you
14505,well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth
14506,you know what Sweets Mommy is just gonna call your doctor very very quickly
14507,the thirteen women put on different kinds of complicated underwear
14508,he's splitting on his head oh my gosh it does look like he's doing a split
14509,I know we're missing that page aren't we
14510,great you clean the poop off and now you can eat it
14511,underpants panty+hose stockings petticoats slips and bras
14512,xxx well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it
14513,I can't said the elephant please begged the bird
14514,for fifteen cents cents I don't really know the rest of it
14515,do you want to put the pictures of Trevor and phoebe into the birthday card
14516,a building's going up in town but first the workers dig deep down
14517,one woman who's feet always freeze puts on wool socks over her stockings
14518,I won't be gone long sir I give you
14519,pickle car and I are sorry P S Pig said Mr Frumble
14520,she's lying down pretending to go to sleep
14521,looks kind of like a little egg doesn't it
14522,there's another big egg but it doesn't look like the others
14523,I'll hurry right back why I'll never be missed
14524,that's alright she says thank goodness no one was hurt
14525,let's go watch the busy scene and learn the name of each machine
14526,she's wearing a slip which is kind of like a skirt but it goes under your skirt
14527,okay now we're gonna pour it into our Jello cups
14528,I will fold them up and I'll put them in with the card
14529,you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to
14530,did you give Baby Passie some juice or some milk this morning
14531,what type of animals are on there can you tell me
14532,right and you know what if you lick it it lasts a lot longer than if you chewed it
14533,maybe you wanna feed her a little juice or milk
14534,now we have_to put them in the refrigerator to set for a little bit
14535,I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered
14536,clean up this is the way we clean up the dirty dirty dirty kitchen
14537,hm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
14538,oh no my hat says Mr Frumble come back hat
14539,every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
14540,Miss Mary Mack Mack Mack all dressed in black black black
14541,the first thing to do is to prop up this
14542,P S Pig picks up all the letters goodbye children goodbye Mr Frumble she says
14543,okay and when that red light goes off then they'll be ready okay
14544,that is a different type of lizard called an iguana
14545,ah I think she's pulling up her stockings
14546,then Toad began to bang his head against the wall
14547,with silver buttons buttons buttons all down her back back back
14548,oh yeah it was a little snowflake it broke off you're right
14549,and make it much stronger that has to be done
14550,uh a newt is actually quite small and an iguana is quite large
14551,she asked her mother mother mother for fifteen cents cents cents
14552,why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog
14553,you do need something to eat what do you think you would like to eat
14554,Molly Anna Max and Mark will fly a kite have lunch and then will learn to count from one to ten
14555,I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story
14556,how do you say baby Ariel in that little high voice of yours
14557,what he needs is a special friend to cheer him up
14558,then carefully tenderly gently he crept
14559,and that too right mushy mushy one
14560,on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had come to Pride rock to celebrate the birth of their newborn cub Simba
14561,why don't you look right over here for a minute because these little dishes are so cute sweetie
14562,she's got she's pulling her stockings up
14563,it looks kinda like a candle that little piece
14564,then Horton the elephant smiled now that's that and he sat and he sat
14565,because he banged his head against the wall oh no
14566,as part of the celebration I had a special duty
14567,well he has a headache now he hurt his head
14568,that's right you went to an easter+egg hunt with Matt and you found eggs
14569,when all the men have their underwear on they get into long sleeved white shirts and button them up
14570,the first thing we have_to do is make them call each other on the telephone Hilda says
14571,he's Sam's going to get dressed right
14572,I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
14573,oh it's a twisty misty one
14574,he's sitting on it he's keeping it warm
14575,uh would you like to read a book Sweetie pie
14576,I wonder if they're gonna eat those little berries
14577,and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a
14578,Stella help called Sam my head grew bigger in the night
14579,I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore
14580,it was a lovely day for a swim
14581,then I lifted the future king up high for all to see
14582,we havta think about what type of cupcakes we're gonna make for your birthday to bring to school
14583,Huckle and Lowly ride straight over to Mr Frumble's house
14584,you know what honey mommy needs you to have some calcium so why don't you have some chocolate milk
14585,forty five men stand up to get into their pants
14586,hello Mr Frumble how are you doing the boys ask
14587,the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down and the zebras stamped their hoofs with happiness
14588,oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible
14589,it poured and it lightning it thundered and rumbled this isn't much fun the poor elephant
14590,Stella called Sam I can't find my underpants
14591,I'm doing fine except I feel terrible about smashing P S Pig's mailbox he says
14592,I know there must be some other girls in class that are your friends
14593,did you look in the bottom drawer asked Stella
14594,would you like me to tell you a story Toad
14595,each pair of pants has a shiny black stripe down the outside of each leg
14596,I wish she'd come back because I'm cold and I'm wet I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't
14597,maybe you should call P S Pig and tell her how you feel says Lowly
14598,the men zip zippers and button a button or two
14599,but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach enjoying the sunshine way off in
14600,once upon a time said Frog there were two good friends
14601,oh it's okay Sweetie Pie I think I might've knocked it over
14602,wow he's got a bicycle doesn't he
14603,one man has wavy black hair streaked with white like lightning
14604,hello P S says Mr Frumble this is Mr Sorry I want to apologize for morning into your mailbox this bumping
14605,ooh let's be careful it doesn't get stuck all over everything
14606,and having such fun such a wonderful rest decided she'd never
14607,he puts on a very soft white shirt with ruffles down the front
14608,the frog was not feeling well and asked his friend the toad to tell him a story
14609,yeah we're both yawning today aren't we
14610,the elephants and do you remember what this is
14611,every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
14612,oh the pictures are nice aren't they
14613,you are so smart I forgot to tell Daddy that you told me that yesterday
14614,this man hooks a wide black cloth belt around his waist
14615,he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one
14616,okay you hold that and I'll take you for a walk
14617,oh they do have shiny stickers on them you're right
14618,um Charlie went to go visit his grandpa but he was back yesterday wasn't he
14619,back at Hilda's Huckle and Lowly tell the girls about the phone call
14620,he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one
14621,when that red light goes off you can try your Jello
14622,and they have_to go search for it in the in the lake
14623,not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
14624,he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story
14625,well maybe it wasn't romantic but at least they spoke to each other on the phone says Hilda
14626,yeah you know oh my gosh do you know where Charlie's grandpa lives
14627,that's some garbage I'm just gonna throw that away
14628,home to my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
14629,you know daddy wears a cummerbund when he wears his tuxedo which is his black suit and like when mommy and daddy have_to go when we have to go to a wedding
14630,you remember where Trevor and Phoebe are going tomorrow morning
14631,uh you know what this one actually if it just had this part here it'd be a trumpet but see this big long thing
14632,what are you doing with that little candy there Honey
14633,so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves
14634,on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
14635,really are you nice or are you mean
14636,you know what I should probably call Ronnie and tell her that you have a cough
14637,then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better
14638,mm I think you're getting it all over the place Honey
14639,grandmas and grandpas all live in New_York
14640,that's Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
14641,no because you haven't used all those stickers up see there are more princess stickers in there
14642,and then came the winter the snow and sleet and icicles hung from
14643,so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story
14644,a trumpet you play like this xxx a trombone you play like this xxx
14645,as part of the celebration I had a special duty
14646,you know what they're actually going to Hawaii
14647,dear Puddle I love family reunions great great aunt Peg is one hundred years old today wait until you see what she gave me your friend Toot P_S I'll be home for christmas
14648,none of the other men wear belts with their pants they button suspenders onto the waist lines of their pants and snap the suspenders over their shoulders
14649,we may not be able to see baby Max if you have a cough
14650,second on Hilda's list was to get P S Pig and Mr Frumble to meet somewhere
14651,moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
14652,his trunk and his feet but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
14653,sometimes people call mushrooms certain types of mushrooms toadstools
14654,I mean I'll just try one bite of your Jello
14655,wow they're gonna go sit on the beach with their daddy
14656,and you know just where Texas is on the map don't you so you know exactly where Charlie went
14657,but Toad didn't answer he had fallen
14658,Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba he said
14659,I don't know if I'm going to eat all the Jello
14660,a toadstool and Toad is sitting under a mushroom called a toadstool
14661,my dear Toot said that ancient aunt this is for you it's my lucky nut
14662,really that'd be nice can I come
14663,hm I think you still do have a little bit of a cough Honey
14664,do you wanna help Mommy make a cup of tea
14665,I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
14666,let me just tell Ronnie and make sure that's okay with her
14667,you are such a good helper in the kitchen Sweetie
14668,Daddy's gonna come too we're gonna sit on the beach
14669,I was first in line until that little hair ball was born he said and Scar stalked out of the cave
14670,back in wood+cock pocket Puddle couldn't wait for Toot any longer christmas was only a few days away and there was everything to do
14671,I'm afraid I may need to eat your toes
14672,so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through and then came the spring time with troubles
14673,four women put on a long four women put on long black dresses and one wears a black jumper over a black shirt
14674,do you wanna put your plates in the little shelf up there
14675,um can I call you back in about five minutes lily's just finishing up her brown study
14676,and do you have you don't have a tuba on your cube do you
14677,xxx Raul there's Steve and Justin and Harry and Mike and
14678,thank you very much let's put that mushy pan away
14679,I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
14680,huh he chopped wood he made decorations he hung lights
14681,this one is Frog and Toad are friends
14682,oh by the way she's wearing the pink um chinese gown
14683,Sweetie let's take your shoes off if you're gonna climb on the couch
14684,his friends gathered round and they shouted with glee look Horton the elephant's up in a
14685,a few of the women put jewelry on a necklace earrings but no bracelets
14686,they walked across xxx they walked in the woods and along the river
14687,watch your step Mr Frumble the boat's turning over oops
14688,because we didn't use the big one we used the small ones right
14689,hm I don't think Ronnie's home actually
14690,don't ask me I don't even know what his real name is that's really sad
14691,Puddle signed all the cards merry christmas blank and Puddle he would have_to wait until Toot returned home before he could mail them
14692,do we have a picture of ourselves on our card this year
14693,before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
14694,oh does that look like an old bone that's a good idea then
14695,then I lifted the future king up high for all to see
14696,bracelets would get in the way when they're working
14697,they taunted and teased him they yelled how absurd old Horton the elephant thinks he's a
14698,over here Mr Frumble P S Pig calls from the other boat
14699,oh drat said Toad not only do my feet hurt but I have lost one of my
14700,early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
14701,you wanna put the mixer back on it
14702,the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down
14703,yes there's a little guy named Mike in Monsters_Inc you're right
14704,grab the oar says P S come on Mr Frumble you're almost in
14705,to Puddle look he's sending an email on the computer
14706,they laughed and they laughed and they all ran away and Horton was lonely he wanted to
14707,as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
14708,I think he went to the library this morning but we're gonna see him later
14709,I forgot to tell you which Lily just reminded me of I was asking her about all her friends at school yesterday and I said oh what about Henry and she goes Henry wasn't there and I said Henry wasn't there she goes he had a fever
14710,oh don't worry said Frog we'll go back to all the places where we walked and you will soon find your button
14711,she's showing her appreciation for other cultures
14712,mm it's a bigger one though so I think it's probably a cello or a bass
14713,look Simba he said everything the light touches is our kingdom
14714,xxx wow oh we gotta get our little whisk in there don't we
14715,yeah Puddle's looking at the computer and this is what he sees on the screen an email
14716,Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance
14717,you're right but that one doesn't have batteries silly
14718,luckily they were all wearing life jackets
14719,all the men put on black bow+ties some tie them on in front of mirrors and some stare into space and tie them
14720,I meant what I said and I said what I meant and elephant's faithful
14721,oh that's not my button said Toad my button my button is white and that button is black
14722,well it's not lunchtime now and Alec's not at home
14723,wow you do have eyes and eyebrows that's true

14727,Puds Edinberg is having an ice storm all flights are delayed don't decorate the tree without me I'm on my way home somehow your pal Toot P_S I'm full of christmas spirit
14728,that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
14729,I was taking little pictures of you
14730,we are we're gonna see him a little bit later right around lunch time okay
14731,wow what colors did you put in that ball
14732,no matter what happens this egg must be tended
14733,the thin man whistles a tune as he ties his tie
14734,that's Jackie and Steve and remember we went to the aquarium with them xxx Carly and Sam
14735,but I thought a king can do whatever he wants
14736,yeah I was taking little pictures of you with the camera
14737,let's see let's make sure it's firm
14738,but poor Horton's troubles were far far from
14739,you're pretending your box is a little doggy
14740,a sparrow flew down excuse me said the sparrow did you lose a button because I found one
14741,twenty seven men have clip+on ties that are already made into bows the man with the wavy black and white hair the ruffly shirt and the cummerbund ties on a very big white bow+tie
14742,well she hadn't gotten into the boat yet Honey Honey Honey
14743,there's more to being king than getting your way all the time
14744,so for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind three hunters came sneaking up softly
14745,and um I've been a very bad study today as I've just had Lily in the kitchen with me and so anyway anyhoo
14746,and now they have another baby girl whose name is Alexandra
14747,well that's not my button said Toad that button has two holes and mine had four holes
14748,do you think baby Cassie is much bigger than the last time we saw her
14749,meanwhile at wood+cock pocket huh Puddle was backing fruit cake
14750,and feet are you gonna have feet too
14751,as king you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures
14752,he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start three rifles were aiming right straight at his
14753,hey sweetie you wanna look at my food book with me
14754,fruit cake is one of Toot's favorite things said Puddle how many do you think we need Tulip asked
14755,yucky you're making a big big mess
14756,um can I wait at least through the weekend and look at my schedule and look at what I'm gonna have due at that time I have_to look at my school schedule and everything okay but I mean it's it's probably gonna to be fine cause we're gonna be gone anyway xxx afternoon well you know and I can read once Lily goes to sleep so
14757,no one else has a tie like this he slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that is short in the front and long in the back where it divides in two like black beetle wings
14758,they went back to the woods and looked on the dark path
14759,I knew you were gonna do that
14760,oh no don't take that out because then it will break
14761,Stella help called Sam I can't see did you turn off the lights
14762,really well look it talks all about bread
14763,we're all connected in the great Circle of life
14764,oh wow what's it gonna do in the city
14765,christmas eve was only one day away how can Toot possibly get home in time Puddle said
14766,oh that's not my button cried Toad that button is small and my button was big
14767,at least give me one you can't have both Honey
14768,later as Simba headed back down the path he ran into Scar
14769,Horton stayed on that nest he held his head high and threw out his
14770,but you can take it out in a minute when Amanda and Jenny are gonna go but not yet because then otherwise it it won't work
14771,Lily do you wanna do you want me to get you something else to eat Sweetie
14772,hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride rock
14773,big but Toad put the small button in his pocket
14774,no it didn't said Stella here it comes
14775,he looked at the hunters as much as to say shoot if you must but I won't
14776,the jacket and pants are called tails
14777,you are the funniest where did you hear that word
14778,my dad showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
14779,xxx a raccoon came out I heard you were looking for a button he said here's one that I found
14780,oh they're gonna buy things at the supermarket in the city
14781,remember when you were a baby we used to sing that song
14782,I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
14783,you are not gonna be able to play with any of your toys if you don't play nicely
14784,sticky sticky sticky and let me clean your sticky mouth too
14785,he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border
14786,maybe you need to sing it a good night xxx a good night song
14787,well that's not my button wailed Toad that button is square and my button is round
14788,I think he is singing what's he singing
14789,I'm glad that she's shy with the way I have her on tape saying defecating
14790,but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with
14791,you're right jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
14792,can you put your other things back in your teapot then
14793,oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
14794,look they all shouted can such a thing be an elephant sitting on top of a
14795,well are they stories about uh yummy things to eat
14796,when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
14797,and that's the very place where Daddy asked Mommy to marry him
14798,I think it has four holes but it's square instead of round
14799,okay well it looks good but I need to look at my school schedule first so I just don't want to say yes
14800,it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just
14801,I think he is look at his little feet
14802,Frog and Toad went back to the river and looked for the button in the mud
14803,the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
14804,Amanda can you hit that blue button on the answering machine
14805,Stella I'm ready and I did it all by myself
14806,that's going to be great now where are you guys gonna go
14807,Toot had finally arrived in Boston it was snowing and very late
14808,you wanna help me put stamps on the on the holiday cards
14809,Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
14810,okay what do you think you'd like to eat Sweetie
14811,oh you're gonna spend the day making a big tower
14812,that's when Trevor was a little tiny baby
14813,oh that's not my button shouted Toad that button is thin and my button was thick
14814,well someone didn't leave a message and then it just keeps beeping and beeping
14815,we'll take him alive why he's terribly funny we'll sell him back home to a circus for
14816,they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
14817,no she does not want to be drawn on
14818,Gabby's coming too that's going to be great

14820,beeping and beeping you wanna read another book Sweets
14821,like cereal yeah you wanna try some of Mommy's
14822,indeed on the other shore P S climbs out of the pond carrying Mr Frumble
14823,once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
14824,and he would like to go out for a little trip
14825,wow the slug especially I think is particularly yucky because he's kind of slimy
14826,and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on they dug up his tree and put him inside with Horton so sad he practically
14827,because she's only ours for a little bit of time but then she has to go back to school so we can't draw on her
14828,Lily why don't you tell why don't you tell Amanda when about we went to Starbucks the other day
14829,I am afraid I've been nothing but trouble for you lately P S
14830,thank you thank you that's great thanks for helping you're such a good helper
14831,they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
14832,our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine
14833,that's going to be terrific isn't it
14834,that's right both your grandmas and grandpas right

14841,wow xxx those are some slimy bugs huh
14842,that's right we visited them in New York and we'll have_to go visit them again in New York
14843,there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button
14844,I really think we should do something about these wet clothes P S says
14845,but before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
14846,up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet
14847,she did I well I mean I had to lie down with her but yeah for like an hour and a half so I'm hoping that this evening goes better than last night
14848,oh said Toad it was here all the time
14849,oh why do you abuse poor Ariel so that hurts Ariel
14850,right we sat down on two of them what happened then
14851,we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands and right now we are all in very real danger
14852,it was feeding time and when the zoo+keeper wasn't looking
14853,we have_to take out pictures for you to take to school with you to put on your cubbie
14854,what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog
14855,no because I don't want it to get stuck in my hair
14856,nobody was there when I answered the phone
14857,and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and
14858,well says Hilda that didn't quite work out the way we planned but at least they're together
14859,the man slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that has a shortened front oh yes that black beetle wings
14860,Mommy's just gonna get a little coffee
14861,Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf
14862,well this man came over and sat down like there are three chairs around the fireplace
14863,they were so quiet that I couldn't hear them
14864,and out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
14865,it's true it is Mommy loves Toot and Puddle
14866,and Lily and I were sitting at two of them and the whole place was empty no one was there
14867,um I shall call you back as soon as I can because I wanna hear about your coffee
14868,I'll get it for you Mr Frumble P S calls and off they run

14871,Charlie was visiting his grandpa but he was back yesterday right he wasn't there tuesday
14872,tonight all the other ninety men put on tuxedo jackets
14873,there's no doubt about it said Sally we're the best matchmakers ever
14874,rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray and Horton sat day after day after day
14875,and I'm sure you don't want it on tape
14876,and this guy comes in and says oh is anyone sitting here

14894,they put on overcoats jackets or caps boots or rubbers mitten or gloves
14895,okay now we're gonna put a stamp right up here
14896,not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled
14897,there was a wonderful park nearby and Marvin loved to swing
14898,we went again and he was sitting on the same chair and Lily was like oh let's sit on the purple chairs so I'm like honey we're not gonna sit on the purple chairs and she's like why why

14921,she goes which man you no wanna talk to
14922,yes said Toad I will go behind these rocks and put on my bathing suit

14925,where is the man you don't wanna talk to I'm like get out of the store
14926,I don't wear a bathing suit said Frog
14927,oh yes here let me put mine back on

14929,what if Toot tumbled into a hole and couldn't get out
14930,what did Maria say that day to Tamar at the play+ground
14931,I was first in line until the little hair ball was born said Scar and he stalked out of the cave
14932,xxx well I do said Toad and after I put on my bathing suit you must not look at me until I get into the water
14933,great I didn't want to hear I didn't want him to hear that we didn't want to talk to him last time but he was a little bit intrusive last time

14974,Marvin was perfectly content with his new life

14977,xxx you can take it out of the box now if you want

14999,hey Sweetie can you go over there so I can see you do a tushy shake and a jump
15000,Max said Ruby something's in your underwear drawer that should not be there

15063,um I would guess like six fifteen it's at Lincoln center
15064,Honey can we keep your sticky hand out of mommy's hair Sweets
15065,and they walk out of one hundred and five doors into one hundred and five streets
15066,Max put all the toys in the toy chest
15067,two fish tails going swish swish swim to the duck
15068,right I'm not I haven't written anymore cards yet though so we have_to wait to write more cards
15069,then what shall we do with it once we make it into a ball
15070,I hopped on a train and then a bus and then a plane and then a bicycle and one led one thing led to another all the way to Coco_Poche
15071,she lined up the Santas and the dolls the sneakers went into Max's closet and the wind up bugs went into the bug box
15072,and there they take taxi cabs cars subways or busses to the middle of the city
15073,she climbed to the tippity top of a tree gazing out on the world she thought where could Mom
15074,Dad we're pals right and we'll always be together right said Simba
15075,the big day has come Miss Honey waits in the school storeroom for her dress
15076,I helped you and now you're not stuck anymore
15077,I had a whim Toot exclaimed how in the world did you get here
15078,right did mommy get a big lump on her head

15081,a beetle named Betty buzzed by this high perch a child needs a mother may I please help you
15082,Simba let me tell you something my father told me
15083,the same way Puddle said I went looking for you and one thing just led to another all the way here
15084,I'm sorry I'm late Miss Honey says Hilda
15085,right when they come out we'll know what their names are
15086,it's getting a little tiresome don't you think
15087,it's alright Hilda she says as she tries on the dress
15088,the man with the black and white wavy hair wears a black coat with a velvet color and a white silk scarf
15089,great kings of the past look down on us from these stars
15090,Lily's response to me when I was like oh she was like I have a boo+boo on my finger
15091,you don't have a little brother or sister but you have cousins right
15092,I think it's time for that cough to go away
15093,so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
15094,I see you the kids are so funny because they're
15095,we have a couple more cards to send we could
15096,I don't know for sure but I'll offer this clue if I were your mom I'd be looking for
15097,isn't it exciting to be in such a faraway place Toot asked
15098,oh no Hilda says I made too many sleeves
15099,he steps into a very long car that is waiting for him outside his apartment building
15100,we have_to write little notes to people on our cards
15101,she's actually the second oldest but a lot of them are really young like they just turned two
15102,four crickets chirping in the thickets leap to the duck
15103,Tulip will be worried that we're both missing said Puddle I'd better give her a jingle
15104,don't worry Hilda says Miss Honey maybe with a few changes we can make the best of things
15105,while the driver drives the man opens his case and looks at some papers
15106,were you up playing games with Daddy last night
15107,they flew through the trees spying down from the sky and asked all the butterflies fluttering by
15108,do you know what kind of cheese you had for snack today at school
15109,do you think I wonder if Grandma and Grandpa the grandmas and grandpas will get their presents today
15110,I found him Puddle said we're fine we'll be back soon
15111,would you like to have a little brother or sister or would you like to be mommy's only baby so that I pay all my attention to you
15112,I practically gift wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them he said
15113,but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone
15114,did you finally go to sleep in your big girl bed
15115,that they're all like great during the day and like the minute the moms come to pick them up they're like xxx like they burst into tears
15116,was it white cheese or yellow cheese or orange cheese
15117,you don't want Daisy to get stuck on the camera right
15118,Sweetie are you gonna wear big girl underpants one day
15119,hey Lily what's your favorite what are your favorite foods
15120,she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig
15121,five frogs hopping on logs jumped to the duck
15122,yeah you know what I think I see that one with the black long hair right
15123,well grandma Rosie called because um next month mommy and daddy have tickets to go see a play in New York
15124,if you had to sit on a desert island and you could only have your favorite foods what foods would you bring with you
15125,have you seen my mom she's like me
15126,the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
15127,they have the highest mountain in the world in Nepal said Toot
15128,I'm sorry Toad said Frog everyone wants to see how you look
15129,Krusty was one of Lily's first words like literally when she had five words or so
15130,when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
15131,but until you use the potty you have_to wear diapers
15132,oh let's see what else did you do in school
15133,and um we thought it would be fun if you had a sleepover with auntie and Phoebe and Trevor when we went to go see the play
15134,are you sure this is a good idea asked Puddle
15135,I will stay right here until they go away said Toad
15136,now you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
15137,the sly spider laughed as he gobbled his snack a bear is a mother who's yellow and black
15138,it was dirty and Mommy Daddy and Krusty was one of them because this used to hang in the front of our car on our windshield like on the inside
15139,I don't know if there is anyone with long white hair
15140,the turtle and the lizards and the snake and the dragonflies and the field mouse all sat on the river bank and waited for Toad to come out of the water
15141,six skunks climbing over trunks crawled to the duck
15142,moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly
15143,but then we didn't know you know auntie's friend Jason
15144,did you have anything else with the cheese and bread
15145,you saw a white dog named Daisy on tv
15146,whew puffed Puddle that was fun when they climbed to the top of the mountain
15147,with her heart full of joy she peered over her straw but it wasn't her mother that Miss Spider saw
15148,maybe he does we'll have_to give it to him when he gets home hah
15149,this sleeve makes a nice belt don't you think Miss Honey says
15150,right they call daddy uncle Don and you call him daddy
15151,oh was it a commercial for that white fluffy dog named Daisy
15152,you were a little little little little girl and you would say Krusty
15153,we'd better hurry everyone's waiting for us
15154,I'm glad we did it together said Puddle
15155,we didn't know if the dogs would be at auntie's house and I know you don't like the dogs right
15156,it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried your dinner's here darlings so open up wide
15157,all of Busy Town has come for the wedding
15158,Toad was getting colder and colder
15159,as they hiked down the mountain Puddle was quiet
15160,before she could blink she was whisked out of sight and brave beetle Betty was hugging her
15161,Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
15162,what's wrong Toot asked are you getting pooped out
15163,I will have_to get out of the water he said I'm catching
15164,and I said to Daddy oh no what are we teaching her
15165,there were frogs I don't think there are now right
15166,oh thank you that was a nice way to say that
15167,so grandma Rosie said you should either have a sleepover with Phoebe and Trevor if the dogs are not there but if the dogs are there then you could come into New York with us and have and grandma Rosie and papa Jay would watch you instead so you wouldn't have_to be with the dogs
15168,that happens to me every time said Toot I love to go off on a trip and when the time comes I love to go back home
15169,I just wanted to let you know that Lily and I have a bit of a cough
15170,well I don't think he's lost anything right now but maybe he was out looking for his hat
15171,Toad climbed out of the river and the water dripped out of his bathing suit and down on to his feet
15172,in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree the kind beetle asked won't you stay here
15173,oh okay I wonder if we could brush Ariel's hair it's very tangled
15174,Daddy likes to watch the Simpsons doesn't he
15175,eight possums nibbling on blossoms crawled to the duck
15176,well maybe you'd like to go read a book
15177,do you Miss Honey promise to love Bruno Bear and live happily ever after asks Mayor Fox
15178,the turtle laughed the lizards laughed the snake laughed the field mouse laughed and Frog laughed
15179,oh the frogs are going in their own purple tank
15180,what are you what the long the woman with the long white hair
15181,then Miss Spider smiled and held Betty fast I looked for my mom and I found you
15182,so I wanted to see how you felt about that
15183,you know what the daddy's name is on the Simpsons
15184,now Bruno place the wedding ring on Miss Honey's finger
15185,what are you laughing at Frog said Toad
15186,xxx which ones do you put the little food in their little cage
15187,for finding your mother there's one certain test you must look for the creature who loves you the
15188,because Lily though I've been telling her to
15189,of course replies Bruno xxx I can't find the ring Bruno whispers
15190,well you know what Sweetie xxx you want me to go get Ariel's brush
15191,you put your napkin in your cup and threw them away
15192,without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
15193,I'm laughing because you do look funny in your bathing suit said Frog
15194,remember when I put you in the car and you said the sweet smell of snow
15195,okay Sweetie Angel why don't you go pick a new book out
15196,and do you like to sit on that hammock with Phoebe
15197,nine snakes leaving little wakes slithered to the duck
15198,but Mr Fix It has an idea he opens his toolbox and takes out a nut and a bolt
15199,mm close to mice they look kinda like mice you walk up the steps and you put the little food down so they can eat
15200,oh blonde well this is sort of long isn't it

15204,even though I've been trying to teach her to cover her coughs she's been having these long hacking fits and I can't get her to cover her mouth
15205,I'll just call daddy and tell him although he's probably not at his desk
15206,here you go Mr Fix It gives the nut to Bruno this one should fit
15207,what else woujou bring on your desert island honey
15208,Mufasa plunged into the gourd and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
15209,oh okay wait hang on let me see I think see Honey
15210,at eight twenty five on friday night in the middle of the city one hundred and four people walk onto the big stage in philharmonic hall
15211,he found Simba grabbed him the nape of his neck and pulled him onto a nearby ledge
15212,thank you Mr Fix It you're a genius says Bruno
15213,Toad was sitting on his front porch when Frog came along and said what's the matter Toad you look sad

15215,great and did you tell Amanda you have snack time at school
15216,hooray everyone cheers as Bruno and Miss Honey come out of the school
15217,ten dragonflies zooming through the skies whirred to the duck
15218,but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
15219,and you remember what the little boy's name is
15220,look at that Toot is trudging through Boston in the snow
15221,berries you do like berries like strawberries and blueberries and raspberries woujou bring them

15223,yes said Toad this is my sad time of day
15224,well not yet Mommy hasn't come for snack time yet but one day I will it's a co_op so you have duty days where the parents all go in

15230,you tell stories about hammocks while you're lying on the hammock
15231,so uh so for Hanukkah here's what we got for Matthew
15232,very unhappy because he thinks he's not gonna get any mail right

15239,Jasmine it's the law the Sultan insisted it'll be your birthday in just three days
15240,later Scar found Simba hovering over his father sobbing
15241,she calls smoked gouda cheese smoked Buddah cheese
15242,I promised Puddle I'd be home tonight thought Toot
15243,I don't love Prince Akhmed Jasmine replied oh Father how can you force me to marry someone I don't love
15244,I have chest congestion and my nose is all stuffed up and this cough
15245,thanks said the duck who got out of the muck down by the deep green marsh

15317,Toot was startled by a tinkling jingling sound as he peered into the dark he saw a faint light coming toward him
15318,then Frog ran back to Toad's house Toad was in bed taking a nap
15319,and then these very super big ones are the basses

15487,thank you Hilda says Lowly but let's wait until tomorrow when it's Valentine's Day

15492,and Graham's mommy stays home to take care of Graham the way I stay home take care of you
15493,he is the conductor the leader of the orchestra and he holds a stick in his hand
15494,and that was a problem because Franklin was going to school for the very first time
15495,and what about the girls what girls were there today
15496,Lowly comes over to Hilda I'm making a Valentine at my home for you too
15497,it's called a baton which is French for stick
15498,he looks a little scary but he's still very nice
15499,it's a special Valentine made with love and care
15500,it was a plant eater and although it looked like a modern day rhinoceros they were only distantly related
15501,hum well Pluto is so so far away that we're not sure what's on it
15502,I do have a cough and the doctor might call some medicine in for me which would be so great because Mommy is tired of feeling lousy
15503,dry those tears she said you can't go to the ball looking like that
15504,when Simba arrived back at Pride rock he found the land bare and dry
15505,it doesn't look like there's anything in it
15506,you wanna help me put the powder in my cup
15507,with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown
15508,it had a large forked horn on its snout shaped like the letter Y
15509,the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
15510,where's your new bag for school do you wanna go in the kitchen and get it
15511,probably not very much it's very very very very cold on Pluto
15512,that is a man in deep water diving equipment
15513,I'm gonna try to make some spaghetti and meatballs because I think I might be able to do that let's see with play dough
15514,that means all the girls were there today
15515,suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
15516,you know how you have your pink medicine that you've been taking
15517,look out Hilda the sidewalk is icy he calls
15518,and with one more wave Cinderella had tiny glass slippers on her feet
15519,maybe we'll leave our mixer out because we might make rolls later for dinner
15520,they ate leaves and fruit from trees and bushes
15521,trucks come to rescue when there's a fire
15522,xxx auntie lives in Rhode island but she works at your school right she's a teacher
15523,xxx wanna help me put the powder in or no
15524,as the fire truck rushes to help its sirens and flashing lights warn everyone to move aside
15525,Simba I'm a little surprised to see you alive
15526,before Cinderella left for the ball she received a warning
15527,let me help you pick up your apples Hilda says Huckle what are you doing with this stuff anyway
15528,you know what Sweetie go in the kitchen your new bag is in the kitchen
15529,give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart said Simba
15530,on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken and everything will be as before
15531,and this very deep bottom part of the ocean is called the abyss
15532,there should try trace wherever that light that's plugged into because there's outlet I know it's plugged in so there's gotta be is it behind the couch
15533,Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba
15534,where volcano underwater volcanos spit hot smoky liquid into the water
15535,and it was a meat eater and used to use its large hooked beak to eat
15536,that night at the ball the prince met Cinderella and without knowing each other's names they danced and danced until the clock struck midnight
15537,Hilda invites Huckle home to see it close your eyes and I'll show you what I made but you must promise not to tell
15538,look the conductor raises the baton into the air and way up on the ceiling of philharmonic hall six chandeliers sparkle silently
15539,Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily
15540,she doesn't stay for lunch because she only goes at nine fifteen to eleven forty five
15541,okay I'm gonna put my powder in
15542,a rescue boom is a tall ladder that can reach five or six stories
15543,limping badly Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock
15544,a little bit of medicine is good when you don't feel well but a lot of medicine is not very good for you
15545,the giant sloth was truly huge about twenty feet from nose to tail
15546,so they xxx we were instructed to get a bag that has xxx zippers or anything just like a tote bag
15547,he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom
15548,that is a bunch of very ah look at those nails they're so dirty I havta clean them ah
15549,it's my first day of school he told Goldie the fish
15550,the giant sloth grasped branches with its long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue
15551,the conductor brings the baton down and the hall which is as wide and long as a red velvet football field
15552,Franklin packed his new pencil case with a ruler a pencil an eraser and twelve colored pencils that he had sharpened himself
15553,um which kind of treats would you go with you to the desert island honey
15554,Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub
15555,the next day the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper
15556,but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult
15557,oh you know what we'll bring your umbrella to Alec's house when we get out of the car you can walk with it inside wouldn't that be great
15558,with their friends around including Zazu Pumbaa and Timon a new celebration of life took place
15559,when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite she locked Cinderella in her room
15560,it's Valentine's Day and Hilda waits for Lowly in the park
15561,oh no I got you and I'm going to hug you and squeeze you
15562,after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub I held him up for all the kingdom to see

15598,oh she's wearing a blue bow in her hair
15599,I already have a full tummy he said it feels like it's full of jumping frogs
15600,anyway I think it's nice to sleep in your bed without Mommy in it because then you have more room to yourself
15601,I think mommy would bring chocolate to her desert island too
15602,it's true you did do you remember the name of the store where we got the new ones
15603,it is eight thirty on Friday night and the one hundred and five men and women dressed completely in black and white have gone to work turning the black notes on white pages into a symphony
15604,Snow white's stepmother the queen was jealous of Snow white's beauty
15605,xxx you said the word it says Lily on it
15606,wonder if that fish is a friend of Nemo's
15607,we have a lot in common honey I would bring cheese too I think and bread too
15608,I felt that way on my first day of too my first day of school too but the funny feeling went away
15609,each day the queen would ask magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest one of all
15610,xxx should we look in here at some of your other dinosaurs
15611,can Mommy put it on because we don't wanna lose that

15615,they are the members of the philharmonic orchestra and their work is to play music
15616,and last last time I slept in your bed Nemo told me that he didn't have enough room to sleep
15617,finally it was time to go to school
15618,one day the mirror said a lovely maid I see who is more fair than thee
15619,I know they didn't have a t+rex there but the velociraptor is close to a t+rex don't you think
15620,Sweetie you know what you can hold them until we go out but once we go out Mommy's gonna have_to hold them okay

15626,that's how I felt when I started school he said but look all your friends are waiting for the bus too
15627,that's a little musical note I think that's a cleft
15628,more room for Nemo when Mommy sleeps in her own bed
15629,a recycling truck carries away trash but this trash will not go to a dump
15630,little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow white the evil queen was watching nearby

15637,one morning the little mermaid Ariel went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend Flounder

15653,xxx woujou like to draw a picture with your princess markers
15654,you wanna finish Lion king or you wanna read Franklin
15655,do you know where I can stay she asked a group of friendly animals

15664,hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride land

15666,they stirred with big spoons swirling and tasting batter
15667,what was that he asked did you hear something
15668,they peaked in the oven at two rows of cakes
15669,my dad just showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
15670,oh you're it is it's going in the wrong direction
15671,suddenly a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship
15672,hey oh that girl drew a picture of the kitty cat
15673,my big sister showed me how to write my numbers he said
15674,golden brown cakes for their friends on Plum Street
15675,the sea urchins no they're very sharp and pointy
15676,come on cakes whispered Sam I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait
15677,he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border did he
15678,wow let's see if our barometer's working today
15679,the sea urchin is covered with sharp spines which ward off attackers on its underside it has five teeth to chew up tough seaweed
15680,Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
15681,you know what I think we're gonna drive in the car
15682,mhm djou want me you want me to help you get it out
15683,xxx yes it is it says it's a lovely day today

15687,Amanda gave it to us it's from Amanda comes and she makes little films
15688,maybe I'll make a heart for valentine's day out of play dough
15689,that's what the underside those are his teeth
15690,mommy took the train but that's because she went by herself
15691,when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
15692,when the bus arrived Rabbit grabbed his sister's hand and climbed aboard
15693,you want a smaller colored piece or a smaller white piece
15694,xxx that's right the egg cracked it was a little bit of a mess
15695,and it was so lovely to be by myself on the train
15696,as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
15697,Bear stood on the steps and waved goodbye again and again
15698,come on I just heard about this great place he said
15699,wow you wanna tell Amanda who the rest of the kids in your class are
15700,in the spring a tractor pulls a seed drill to plant seeds in the ground
15701,okay but I'm gonna use the white one
15702,the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
15703,even though he was a very small fish Flounder had a very big
15704,what would be a good thing for us to bake
15705,right daddy goes to work on the train that's true
15706,he kept hugging even after his friends had found seats
15707,a pick up truck may not be big but it has a powerful engine
15708,Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
15709,as the bus pulled away Franklin looked out the window
15710,they waited and waited and then at last Mrs Bear sniffed the air with her nose in the air and said I believe our cakes are ready
15711,and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
15712,you're right he is an apatosaurus or a brontosaurus
15713,he didn't know if he was ready for school
15714,Nala led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
15715,you're gonna you put in a little guy you put in Splashy
15716,the animals led Snow white to a tiny cottage in the woods
15717,after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
15718,do you think the teacher will yell wondered Rabbit who jumped at loud noises
15719,well this is the coffee table that's more like a side table
15720,once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
15721,Mrs Bear and Sam counted cakes and there were twelve
15722,do you think there's a bathroom asked Beaver fidgeting in her seat
15723,she knocked on the door but no one answered
15724,you don't have_to wear them right now but I think you would like to wear them it's sunny out right
15725,a lot of the snow melted huh do you think the rest of the snow is gonna melt today
15726,they tucked them in bags and there were twelve red bags
15727,they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
15728,I hope someone has an extra snack said Bear who had already eaten his
15729,and when we go to school let's see what should we put in there maybe we'll put in some extra diapers
15730,there's not a pink Sleeping_Beauty there's an orange Sleeping_Beauty
15731,last time we took the train I did my homework on the train
15732,Snow white found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds
15733,look they're wrapping them up and putting the cakes into the bags
15734,and maybe we'll put in a little change of clothes
15735,before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
15736,that makes it easier to drive so that's good news
15737,oh my there must be seven tiny children living here
15738,we're gonna havta brush your teeth which look pink from Pez now
15739,right I can read on the train and I can write on the train

15741,we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands he said
15742,let's clean the house and surprise them she said to the animals
15743,outside snow tumbled on houses and sprinkled the trees
15744,what about the ones that Henry got you for your birthday
15745,do you remember how many legs an octopus has
15746,oh well I don't know if we're gonna have Tamar's party since it's already past her birthday but we can have a party for you
15747,suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
15748,you know what we were thinking um you know what I think we'll do tomorrow with grandma and grandpa honey
15749,right and do you remember how many legs a squid has
15750,I don't know if you showed her last week
15751,soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarves
15752,Mrs Bear and Sam climbed up in the truck that was green
15753,it was Banzai his partner Shenzi and the always laughing Ed
15754,Lily let's show Amanda we have_to make a little page of things about Lily
15755,Snow white promised to wash and sew and sweep for the little men
15756,well in the morning we have_to go to there's a little thing at your school
15757,in fact you know what you should remind Mommy today I will call Gymboree later today and maybe we can make a date for your birthday party would that be great

15759,uh someone's got their snazzy little outfit in there to put on
15760,Zazu tried to lead the cuds cubs to safety but Zanzai grabbed Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down
15761,where you can make um you can draw pictures and they'll put it on to a plate and stuff so we'll go and do that for a bit
15762,the seven dwarfs loved having Snow white stay in their cottage
15763,and what's the other one that Henry got you
15764,were they showing Nemo at B_J's on tv
15765,I dunno maybe he was sitting in a different seat
15766,Lily you know what mommy wants to do on the way back from New York
15767,you wanna bring it over to her to show her
15768,back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow white was hiding
15769,I guess he's sitting in a special car seat huh
15770,do you remember how many legs the squid has xxx
15771,the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
15772,this is more than I've know in the past thirty three years of my life
15773,can you remind me I would like to stop at Trader_Joe's and I need to look and see if there is one between New York and here in Connecticut

15778,they bumped along in the early light just the two of them on Plum Street
15779,well an octopus has eight and a squid has more than eight
15780,the queen was so angry that she drank a potion and turned herself into an old hag
15781,and then we thought maybe we'd go to the R_I_S_D museum with grandma and grandpa would that be fun
15782,well um I don't think Tamar is gonna have her party Honey because it's so far after her birthday now
15783,uphill and down up and down to the very end of Plum Street
15784,he showed them where to hang their coats and where to sit
15785,we don't want it to get stuck all over the rug right
15786,yeah I thought you could show them the big Buddah
15787,we're making our big trudgery over to Ronnie and Alex's after yeah

15790,with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow white's eyes will close forever
15791,well I thought maybe this pink thing was a shell do you think it's a feather
15792,maybe we will stop and get some food on the way back from New York on Monday
15793,our friends will love my cakes Sam told his mama
15794,just because she you know we were in a lot yesterday and it's better for her to get out so
15795,the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss
15796,Daddy's holding your Ariel right you're wearing your princess shirt
15797,Mrs Bear pulled up close to the first sleepy house
15798,a front loader digs and carries dirt and rocks
15799,as soon as the dwarves went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow white
15800,uh the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
15801,he showed them where to find the bathroom and offered everyone a piece of fruit
15802,oh you think a feather's going to pop out of it
15803,here we are Sam I'll wait here and you take the cake

15811,the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves
15812,what's today's date your birthday is in about four weeks or so
15813,while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
15814,go go go Mrs Bear put her arm around Sam
15815,there's a teddy bear sitting in that truck
15816,but by the time the dwarves arrived it was too late
15817,whadidjou eat that was a little bit messy
15818,and I have_to bring um I guess I should get like juice boxes or little water bottles
15819,Snow white had already taken a bite of the poisoned apple and
15820,we could go out we could have lunch with grandma and grandpa too that would be fun huh
15821,and off he went all by himself in new snow
15822,but it was very tasty at the zoo
15823,and then we got it and we've been reading it obsessively for a couple weeks xxx almost every creature
15824,but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
15825,all by himself waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear
15826,they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
15827,she took a bite of that xxx apple and she fell asleep
15828,what would you like to do today Franklin asked Mr owl
15829,hey Lily can you tell Amanda what are your favorite things in the R_I_S_D_Museum
15830,I think a big hug and kiss would make Mommy feel better
15831,so when we go so we have_to go to the mall later honey
15832,finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
15833,the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff
15834,I don't know said Franklin rubbing his tummy
15835,and it was shaped like Dora the explorer
15836,just when it looked as if it was all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
15837,I know he's square like a box it's kind of funny
15838,and oh do you remember the little shells that were all over the rocks what were those

15843,then he ran back to the truck where his mama was waiting
15844,once there was a land that lived in fear of seven goblins
15845,it did melt but we made it it was pretty neat right
15846,I can't write all the numbers like Rabbit can and I can't read like Beaver can

15856,Rabbit and Beaver will learn new things at school and so will you
15857,Mrs Bear and Sam bumped along just the two of them uphill and down up and down
15858,they have a glass sculpture which kind of looks like an hour+glass it's the only thing that you're allowed to touch in the museum
15859,a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below
15860,what else do we havta get oh I havta look in the book store

15865,I can see you're a very good artist said Mr xxx Mr owl
15866,Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
15867,at each sleepy house Mrs Bear stopped the truck

15899,oh okay that's a good idea oh we have_to trim that nail it is so long
15900,finally he asked Mr Owl to help him read his favorite book
15901,he does kind of have a funny fish face funny nose
15902,and is the Buddah big or is the Buddah little
15903,what is that dinosaur that looks like a bird
15904,do you remember where did we see stars on the ceiling
15905,he sorted the money in the classroom store and he painted four pictures
15906,the Buddah is really big djou remember how tall the Buddah is
15907,uh there are the goblins trying to get to the valley to steal the rainbow
15908,wait let me find your microphone it fell off your xxx
15909,one for the teacher one for himself and two for his parents
15910,the sun was just sunning up the little white house
15911,we're gonna get a book for Ronnie right
15912,did we see a rainbow while we were driving
15913,and what are the other sharks' names
15914,hello house said Sam as they went inside kicking off their boots
15915,Franklin sat at the back of the bus all the way home
15916,do you remember in your book your book on prehistoric animals what's the name of the animal that looks like an elephant but he's really hairy
15917,where all the stars were all over the sky
15918,you're gonna have a delicious taste of that cake
15919,Mrs Bear poured cocoa in cups and they wriggled their toes in fat socks enjoying their cakes with cocoa
15920,and did you tell Amanda who's coming for Thanksgiving
15921,he bumped up and down ooh don't hurt your boo+boo Sweetie
15922,squishy shark maybe wanna show your squishy shark to Amanda it's on the table
15923,and as their bellies filled up they took turns telling stories
15924,the sun had almost set by the time they reached their goal
15925,and I said that's just what I was thinking
15926,that's a hag+fish which has teeth on its tongue ew
15927,stories about a bear called Sam who takes cakes to his friends
15928,remember the one in your book that looks like an elephant but he's covered in fur
15929,Mommy has to go blow her nose one more time
15930,ew it has teeth on it's tongue ah
15931,and that's what happened one winter morning on Plum Street
15932,okay can I finish the book and then I'll go get blankie
15933,whoa hey sweets I was thinking that uh maybe since Emily is coming over later maybe you'd wanna make some cookie dough and then when Emily gets here we could bake the cookies whada you think
15934,he was so busy having fun he almost forgot to get off at his stop
15935,that would be a great cookbook a cookbook about food
15936,we're gonna have_to see about that but maybe he'll sleep in your room with you
15937,oh I though some of the flying ones did
15938,and which is the tiger with the very long front teeth
15939,oh and what do you do to take care of the baby
15940,they're gonna try and catch it but I don't think so I think that you can't catch a rainbow
15941,I see your little feet up on that table how didjou get up there
15942,is there another sut oh another song coming up was that the last one
15943,Franklin looked puzzled it had been such a good day he'd forgot all about his jumpy tummy
15944,well that's a good thing because if they caught the rainbow no one would be able to see the rainbow and wouldn't we all be sad
15945,we havta decide what kinda cookies we wanna make
15946,well that's a feeling that will go away too said his father
15947,he stands on his feet and he's kind of furry and he has funny pointed toes that makes it hard to walk
15948,I got a tushie I got a tushie
15949,she this new thing too is like all her imaginary play sounds like a book like xxx
15950,I made this for you said Franklin's mother and gave him his favorite snack fly pie
15951,we don't want the goblins to steal the rainbow right
15952,well but you know what remember last time mommy's glasses broke so I don't think I want donkey to climb on my glasses
15953,then let's put it away let's not throw it on the floor
15954,who don't we go here says so and so oh yes says so and so
15955,some ocean creatures are mammals they are warm blooded and feed their young with milk they must come to the ocean surface to breathe air
15956,we'll spend the night here in the cave the yellow goblin commanded
15957,and I made this for you said Franklin and gave his parents two pictures and two big hugs
15958,well we can make the batter and then when Emily gets here we can um she can taste the batter before we bake it right
15959,sure right let me know if you need me to get the markers open sometimes they're hard
15960,when the moon rose and saw them warming themselves around the fire they had lit it shouted out an alarm
15961,well because we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair
15962,well I don't want it to dry out I'll just put it back while we read a book and then I'll take it out again okay
15963,ocean mammals have a thick layer of fat or oily fur to protect them from the cold water
15964,oh well you know what I bet daddy'll take you to the children's museum this weekend
15965,the trees and the bushes took up the cry and the flowers and the grasses and the animals and the waters passed it on and by midnight the evil tidings had spread throughout the valley
15966,I seem to go through glasses rather quickly
15967,whales can stay under water for forty minutes or more without breathing
15968,right I was thinking of making banana chocolate chip cookies how does that sound
15969,okay you stay here I'll go get you a a bandaid
15970,a dolphin can stay underwater for two to three minutes
15971,the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
15972,I'm good can I ask you a favor um can you give me a call back in about a half an hour Lily has her Brown thing which goes till ten
15973,then it comes to the surface and how does a dolphin blow
15974,when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
15975,you wanna start with Sleeping Beauty or you wanna xxx djou wanna start in the beginning
15976,you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
15977,well maybe I can but I might have_to work on my homework
15978,soon all the colors of the rainbow will be ours Yellow gloated
15979,honey you could try but I don't think that's gonna close honey
15980,moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
15981,we'll snatch it as it rises when the colors are still fresh and creamy
15982,well we came back here after the dentist because um because Justine came over for dinner right
15983,the blue goblin cackled look at the roots dangling from the walls they're straining to hear our plans
15984,Scar appeared quickly at his side and said stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
15985,you know what I think the pterodactyl looks a little bit like
15986,are you gonna help me make the batter
15987,oh yeah it's in here somewhere let me see
15988,without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
15989,a lot of good it will do them or their friend the rainbow
15990,do you think maybe we should stop by the mall this afternoon
15991,you might havta move the camera Amanda I think we're gonna go into the kitchen for a lil bit
15992,Mufasa plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
15993,finally exhausted by their scheming the goblins fell asleep
15994,Snow White is so sweet and gentle she makes lots_of friends wherever she goes
15995,there is so much stuff in here I can not believe it
15996,outside the moon shone on the mirror like surface of the water and its magical light was reflected in the cave
15997,well daddy's already done with school he doesn't go anymore
15998,well that one's better because sometimes the big ones can get in the way
15999,he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and put him on a nearby ledge
16000,we bought this sweater for you when we went to Ireland
16001,she is always cheerful and looks on the bright side
16002,it's like the leaves when they change colors right
16003,she is romantic and longs to meet her true love
16004,then all seven goblins had a wonderful dream
16005,suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
16006,that was over a year ago you were pretty little
16007,she is also very practical and works very hard
16008,and they have some little bit of hair on their body the way bats do
16009,ooh Honey Honey barrette not close to the eye don't want you to hurt your eye
16010,desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which star Scar stood looking down on him
16011,actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill
16012,well I'm not sure where the juice is we'll havta look
16013,I wonder if a barracuda is actually an eel or just a different kind of fish
16014,of course my sister Ada's actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
16015,oh yeah usually you put the black ones in our hair because that kind could get stuck in your hair because it's a little bit sticky
16016,Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper long live the king
16017,yeah I know I don't see orange in this picture but I bet it's in there somewhere
16018,woudjou like another piece of your pop+tart by the way
16019,bats don't have points on their they have little ears bats have little ears don't they
16020,it's it's a barracuda eel okay I'll look that up just to confirm I'm not sure
16021,don't get me wrong I like being a princess
16022,you can put it close to your forehead that's okay
16023,you know what you ate a lot of when we were in Ireland
16024,but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties
16025,do you want chocolate chips and peanut butter chips in your cookies
16026,oh you can't have lunch okay well then if you can't have lunch then you can't have Pez
16027,mm yeah but you know what that's even that's still too dangerous because we don't want your eye to get hurt
16028,and besides Ada's a good queen even though she worries a lot
16029,you searched and searched and you found it
16030,pterodactyls have points on the back of their heads you're right
16031,she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much
16032,the goblins had a wonderful dream about the paradise of rainbow land where all you had to do was lie on your back and open your mouth
16033,no I think you can pick it up Sweetie because you dropped it on the floor
16034,with hair as black as ebony and lips as red as roses and skin as white as snow this lovely princess is perfectly named Snow White
16035,wouldjou like chocolate chips or chocolate chunks
16036,this is what they gave you for lunch ready
16037,when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything
16038,can you pick it up before it gets stepped on Sweetie
16039,well you know what if you put your barrette on your eye we can't go get Play_Doh
16040,of course there used to be a lot to get upset over
16041,which you didn't wanna eat because it was just kind of this weird fried fish
16042,not only is she beautiful but she is sweet natured too
16043,and the most succulent colors dripped down your throat
16044,alright well I'll finish reading the book when you pick your Playdoh up
16045,you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble
16046,everyone loves her except of course her vain and jealous stepmother the queen
16047,well we have_to pay so we can go to the swim club this summer
16048,it sure does this is the viper+fish but the teeth look just like the angler+fish you're right
16049,the dream went on and on and the greedy goblins drank and drank and at dawn just as their bellies were about to burst they were awakened by a distant clap of thunder
16050,and then they gave you chocolate pudding with chocolate sprinkles
16051,her favorite things include singing and dancing which always cheer her up and give her courage when she's afraid
16052,there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
16053,and then they gave you little chocolate M and Ms
16054,um I don't think there is a face on that one
16055,telling stories is one of Snow White's great talents the seven dwarfs like to listen to her stories about the day her prince will come and how they'll live in a beautiful castle
16056,the goblins sprang to their feet and rushed to the mouth of the cave
16057,right a gulper eel can swallow food three times as wide as its body
16058,they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter
16059,oh okay that's gonna be a little bit hard to clean but I will check it out
16060,um there was look at this beautiful picture honey isn't that pretty
16061,what should we do with that Playdoh that's on the ground
16062,look how the wind is driving it towards us Orange cried
16063,would you like some of the little granola bites with the chocolate chips in them
16064,I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time
16065,so you ate all your chocolate and you were bouncing off the walls because you were so full of chocolate energy
16066,the animals and birds of the forest love Snow White's kind and gentle nature
16067,it's a picture of buildings in New York City with some very pretty autumn leaves on the trees
16068,and all the goblins danced and pranced about in glee
16069,they even helped her clean up the dwarves' messy cottage
16070,now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy
16071,I almost dropped some sweetened condensed milk on the floor
16072,and I'm still waiting for you to pick it up
16073,Snow White loves to walk in the enchanted forest and pick pretty flowers
16074,he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
16075,oh my gosh that's the caterpillar's little tushie
16076,should we go look in the kitchen see if we have
16077,but and you probably don't remember this but there were lots_of kids on our airplane
16078,it's hard to tickle you when you're lying upside down
16079,um that's a little letter saying that they're building a new pool at the swim club
16080,but she can't things into the too many flowers into the cottage because flowers make Sneezy sneeze
16081,once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
16082,huh you're absolutely right grandma and grandpa are coming from New York City to Providence to visit you
16083,djou remember how many legs a squid has
16084,and they thought you were very cute and they would bring you toys
16085,anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine
16086,when dwarfs when the dwarfs find out that Snow White is a good cook they are delighted even more so when they discover she can bake their favorite gooseberry pie
16087,well an octopus has eight legs and a squid has
16088,they would come and talk to you and bring you little stuffed animals to keep you happy
16089,it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do
16090,Snow White's world Snow White lives in an enchanted land with seven jeweled hills and seven waterfalls
16091,yup grandma Barbara and grandpa Richard are coming today
16092,maybe if they had things would've been different
16093,grandma Rosie sent me a newspaper article about going to the potty
16094,what about cars does anyone you know have a grey car
16095,one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention
16096,beyond the farthest hill stands the castle where she grew up with her wicked stepmother
16097,you'll probably get it on there here you go
16098,and it took us so long to get home and you slept almost not at all
16099,that's my birth decade we're back in the seventies
16100,I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda clumsy too
16101,ha ha I love to give you little kisses on your neck
16102,they're I think they're gonna babysit tomorrow for you they're gonna play games with you and read you books
16103,it took us I think sixteen hours maybe to get home
16104,Max parked his popsicle where no one would find it
16105,what are you gonna do once you cut it all into pieces
16106,he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below
16107,gosh it's chilly this whole house is chilly I am so cold
16108,Snow White has nowhere to go and gets lost in the dense forest
16109,oh you're gonna put it all back together into one big ball
16110,then he pushed the up and over button on his brand new power city rocker crushed dump truck
16111,eventually she can run no farther and she falls to the ground in tears oh
16112,the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me
16113,okay I'm gonna need you to help me sweets
16114,well if we don't figure it out you know who we can ask
16115,Max said Max's sister Ruby it's time to clean up
16116,I'm trying to bribe her I'm like that'd be a great toy to have if you sat on the potty
16117,the seven hills really are jeweled because there are dazzling diamonds inside
16118,it was ridiculous and we had lots and lots_of driving to do when we were in Ireland
16119,the seven dwarfs love to dig dig dig all day long in the diamond mines
16120,ah that's part of the thing to send the money to the swim club
16121,maybe she would know the spanish word for dinosaur is
16122,it's not on yet I just need you to help me put things in the bowl
16123,and she's like yeah that's great now are you gonna it on the potty
16124,yep let me just just gonna make a little cup of tea
16125,it is a mess look how messy it is
16126,because in Ireland you hafta drive on the wrong on the opposite side of the road
16127,I'm sure it means something but I don't have
16128,because you are sweet and you are smart and you are funny
16129,uh these are teeth of different sharks this is a tooth to a tiger shark
16130,we'll hafta see djou remember what that book said dinosaur meant
16131,and you're silly that is true you are silly
16132,when Ruby wasn't looking Max emptied the dump+truck into his pocket
16133,Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better
16134,well I'm sure you do but you've got_to sit on the potty in order to get them
16135,can you bring that over to me so it doesn't get all messed up
16136,want me to bring the chair over so you can look
16137,no that dinosaur I guess I don't know what the root of dinosaur is it came from a dinosaur
16138,come climb up on the chair and tell me what you see in the backyard Honey
16139,I was putting you in your car seat you fell into baby Cassie's car seat
16140,well you know what I will use this one so then you can use that one over here
16141,well this is when Snow White is ah lost in the dark forest
16142,well lot's of presents for sitting on the potty
16143,I can't think of a latin thing that ends in a xxx
16144,but Max squeezed the rest of the miracle bubbles into his pocket
16145,oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe
16146,are gonna wanna crack the egg honey
16147,you know honey let's not put strawberry juice on mommy's pants
16148,did you hear Lily's got this one book where it says something is awesome
16149,the horn shark has broad back teeth for crushing shellfish
16150,your ant farm ants have escaped said Ruby
16151,right she got lost but the nice animals helped her out right
16152,whoop don't ah xxx let me put it back on
16153,sweetie you hafta keep it on that's part of having Amanda come
16154,so then she's making up her little stories she's like that's awesome
16155,but Max let the ants run into his pocket instead of into his ant farm
16156,well they don't have a picture of it right here
16157,and they took her to the seven dwarves' cottage
16158,did you tell Amanda what you said to me yesterday
16159,about when you were trying to put the top on your toothbrush
16160,Max said Ruby something's in your underwear drawer that should not be there
16161,Lily do you want a little piece of Pop Tart while you have your microphone on
16162,one of the great gifts that Snow White has is the ability to make friends easily
16163,if you climb up here Honey it's not so sunny
16164,sweetie woujou like to read your prehistoric animals book
16165,look I put it in the shady spot
16166,the animals and dwarfs would do anything for her even Grumpy
16167,maybe you wanna show your little dinosaur to Amanda while I get you a xxx
16168,right in front of you right there look down on the table
16169,a easter egg that's right this easter egg is from last year Max said Ruby into the trash bucket it goes
16170,I think that's love a lot isn't it
16171,we're using all sortsa sugars today
16172,that's right do you see how many leaves we have in the backyard
16173,this is a cookbook and this is a recipe from the first restaurant that mommy and daddy ever had a meal at together
16174,but the queen is madly jealous of her naturally beautiful stepdaughter and the cruel queen is a very dangerous enemy to have
16175,he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us
16176,up right in front of you next to Ariel right here right here
16177,we're using light brown sugar dark brown sugar and white sugar
16178,nope you know why I was thinking this is love a lot cus it's got two hearts
16179,oh it's upstairs okay I'll get it in just a minute okay
16180,if the leaves are still there tomorrow I think we'll rake them ourselves with the rake
16181,what is oozing out from your closet door Max asked Ruby
16182,good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff
16183,versus this one which I think is Tenderheart because it has one heart
16184,she is at the dog park what is she doing at the dog park
16185,Max knew Ruby would find a reason to throw out his popsicle she might even throw out his
16186,but it's possible that Mani might come today and rake them for us
16187,well let's see what it says about tube worms yeah
16188,nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is
16189,right it says here as well as being Snow White's stepmother the queen is also a wicked witch
16190,whatcha doin under the table there little girl
16191,he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen
16192,you're right I don't think you did do the purple
16193,she does not like Snow White and she uses a poison apple to try and get rid of her
16194,well no it says these are their head the orange part is their heads worms whose heads stick out of their white tubelike casings take hydrogen sulfide from the water and bacteria in their bodies make food from it
16195,here's your fork she's feeding her with a fork
16196,Max said Ruby your pillow is in your toy chest and your toys are in your bed
16197,okay I'm bringing my tea over and then we're going to read a book
16198,the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs
16199,mm I don't I think we only have one ankylosaurus don't we
16200,artistic license she needs to add more to her work
16201,Max rescued his very favorite piece of gum on a string from the bottom of his bug box
16202,it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out
16203,you're gonna put some purple on for Amanda
16204,I'm gonna turn it on for a minute okay
16205,some clams and mussels also get food from that same kind of bacteria
16206,Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan
16207,Ruby put all the toys in the toy chest she lined up the Santas and the dolls
16208,oh my gosh you have so many dinosaurs we don't even know what to do with them
16209,we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs
16210,oh because I you I you always tell me you like it break broken in half
16211,so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them
16212,and the sneakers went into Max's closet and the wind+up bugs went into the bug box
16213,the butter was flying out of the bowl
16214,oh yucko do I have Silly_Putty in my hair can we take it out please
16215,the seven dwarfs and the birds and animals that meet Snow White love her dearly
16216,it was a daring plan and Flick was great
16217,they try to protect her from the wicked queen and her spells
16218,look Max said Ruby your room is completely organized there's a place for everything and everything's in its place
16219,blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird
16220,and where didjou go when you were in New York
16221,oh is there oh yes that's right Dora saw a volcano didn't she
16222,it doesn't open or it doesn't close
16223,djou wanna come help me crack the eggs honey
16224,I don't know did you go to a museum
16225,Mama called the doctor and the doctor said no more bone+heads bouncing on the bed
16226,oh here we go there they're closed and then when you sit him up
16227,they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird
16228,and she's saying what a lovely day it is to be walking down the steps in my big white dress
16229,okay you wanna read your shark tale book again
16230,he is always so sleepy isn't he
16231,the prehistoric animals included in this book are just a few of the strange and interesting creatures that once roamed our planet
16232,wow it says vents that look like chimneys spew out hot black water from deep inside the earth
16233,the police man yelled from atop his trike no more nut brains riding on a bike
16234,none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on
16235,oh yeah didjou tell Amanda where you went
16236,it's actually her friend Gabby's baby so I'm not sure
16237,I just put the heat on there I don't know why
16238,and they realized we weren't a real bird after all
16239,water's filled with hydrogen sulfide a chemical that smells like rotten eggs
16240,should we do our we could do our dinosaur puzzle honey
16241,last night the house was eighty degrees and now of course it's sixty degrees we can't seem
16242,but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him
16243,the dentist shouted from his booth no more sharp+tooths munching on a mooth
16244,here's the huntsman he's a loyal servant of the queen but he is not wicked
16245,first let's put can you help me put these back in the basket please
16246,yeah Lily climbed up into that like maze that goes around the ceiling like the bubble
16247,she's way up top look at her on top of the tower
16248,and did we see some of the other animals in your other prehistoric book
16249,woolly mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the woolly mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall
16250,and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all
16251,seeing Snow White's sweet nature he cannot bear to carry out the queen's orders and hurt the princess
16252,mommy has to go to home depot today but it's so cold I just don't know if I can do it whadda you think
16253,it looks like he's eating a lollie doesn't it
16254,did we see the lion with the very big teeth
16255,in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down
16256,well but he decides he cannot hurt Snow White
16257,and instead of just taking her down he was climbing all through the thing
16258,and appeared about two million years ago during the Ice_Age of the Pleistocene epoch
16259,he doesn't want to hurt her so he lets her go
16260,in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave
16261,are we let's take it out and we'll see
16262,I was waiting for him to fall on my head
16263,right what was the one that we saw at the Pequot museum remember we saw one
16264,P_T_Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too
16265,yesterday the sad thing is it was so hot it's called working at the whale wash that I had the heat and the air conditioning on
16266,no it's not nice that he promised to do it in the first place right
16267,oh you think Amanda wants to see her on top
16268,okay let's put them all take them out and put them alright side up with the picture's up
16269,why don't I hold one of your pieces of Pop Tarts until you finish the other one
16270,but Flick just said sorry my place is here
16271,anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill
16272,at the same time just to try and like regulate the temperature
16273,I'm not gonna sing anything if you're hitting me like that
16274,alright where are you gonna sit that I can hold this
16275,during the Ice_Age massive ice sheets called glaciers covered vast areas of land
16276,okay well let's put it together to see what's missing
16277,now see where the crack is I know let's look where the crack is hang on
16278,because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the woolly mammoth managed to keep warm in the year round winter xxx
16279,in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick
16280,we had something to eat didn't we whadju have_to eat
16281,first we have_to find all the end pieces with the straight edges right
16282,what are we gonna do quickly

16290,from the moment that Snow White becomes more beautiful than the queen her life is in danger
16291,djou wanna read one of your princess stories

16293,should we start with should we start with the straight edges honey
16294,a bunny bank is there treasure in the bunny bank too
16295,although the seven dwarfs tried their best they cannot protect her from the queen's black magic
16296,oh my gosh you're stuck you're stuck
16297,the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears
16298,okay why don't you tell me what happens okay

16311,the teacher sighed that's against the rules no more super lizards acting sort of cool

16315,woolly mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia
16316,well at first he thinks he's going to hurt Snow White
16317,three little dinosaurs on a campout Chasmosaurus asked what's a lava tube about
16318,did you tell Amanda what type of pizza you like to eat
16319,prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals
16320,but then he changes his mind he can't bring himself to harm her
16321,oh one can only imagine what you're gonna find under there
16322,you have_to tell her you wanna you want her to see Polly

16330,we do have a new book to read Danielle gave you this book
16331,oh they're so tired they havta take a nap
16332,the saber+tooth tigers first appeared sometime between twenty six and thirty six million years ago
16333,disguised as an old peddler woman the queen persuades trusting Snow White to take a bite of the poisoned apple
16334,it's called Birthday zoo should we read it
16335,the umpire didn't like that talk at all no more big mouths watching baseball
16336,did we see anything else when we were there

16341,how can you be sleeping if you're getting off the couch
16342,look called the scientist at all those fossil stones
16343,so we're looking for a straight edge piece with an apatosaurus
16344,the scientific name for the saber tooth tiger is makeri Machairodont Machairodont Machairodont
16345,Princess Dot is a little ant from A Bug's Life
16346,we haven't been to Baltimore actually in a good long while
16347,she she used to stand in the middle of that green room and stare at the bookcase
16348,as soon as Snow White takes a bite of the apple she falls to the ground in a deep sleep and cannot be woken
16349,this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws
16350,and remember what there was when we first walked into the museum there were three dinosaurs there was a mommy and a baby and another one
16351,trying to think of when the last time was we were down there
16352,this is what you used to do when you were little
16353,when the dwarves find her they place her in a special glass coffin
16354,these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp xxx sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals
16355,before she was actually talking you know a lot of actual words
16356,you know what we should find some more light blue pieces like this
16357,well you know what I already put the butter in what little brown things do we add to our cookies
16358,see if they fit with some straight edges like maybe this one
16359,keep your backpack on I'll put your butterfly wings over your backpack
16360,one of the best know saber+tooth tigers is the Smiladon which means knife tooth in Latin
16361,little kids can eat pepperoni and mushrooms together too
16362,Amanda's going to sit in the green room
16363,exactly you can walk from one end of it to the other
16364,and there was a meat eater also
16365,I'm trying to think of what she said the other she's been so funny with her speech
16366,I don't think I'd want to put a lipper in my eye
16367,xxx can you hand that to me Honey and I'll put it back
16368,you said the other day we were talking about something and I said well we're gonna go to the mall to run an errand or something
16369,but Snow White and the dwarfs and the prince are all very nice aren't they
16370,he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
16371,are is a Carnotaur and a allosaurus the same thing
16372,it's so funny and then she had a couple when Amanda was here actually I think it was just maybe three weeks before you started or something and
16373,can you see if there's some more straight edges in the corner over there sweets
16374,Machrauchenia was a plant eater or an herbivore that xxx
16375,and she said well maybe we'll go here as well
16376,you're so much more interesting than I am Amanda
16377,dinosaur time can I getchou anything else to eat sweetie
16378,see I think they're white if you turn them over yeah let's see what that is
16379,and then wha'd you say you said perhaps to me the other day
16380,you want me to put your wings on Sweets
16381,we need some more forks flurried the storks
16382,yes that's right you were taking turns
16383,and lily was walking around talking about something and she goes and then he did this and then he said defecate
16384,concert day at Terrytown had been a big success
16385,you were sleeping on your special blowup mattress right daddy was lying down with you
16386,the Machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps
16387,he couldn't ride his bicycle without training wheels
16388,I don't know I forgot where it was you were talking about but you said perhaps
16389,let's see if that you wwanna see if it fits
16390,in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
16391,he does not look so nice there either you're right
16392,but Snuffy couldn't decide what his favorite color was so he sang a song about all the colors
16393,should we get you a chair to sit on while you put your chocolate chips in
16394,fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk
16395,and I was laughing oh did you tell Amanda about the car accident
16396,Beaver was the brave one and she took her wheels off first
16397,yeah grandma Rosie and I tiptoed out the door you're right
16398,I think we're gonna have_to look for another piece
16399,concert day was supersonic said Jay Jay as he flew up next to Snuffy
16400,let's try what's that one that your hand is on
16401,about Cinderella she is cheerful and sunny no matter how difficult things are
16402,there were a lot yes we were behind two accidents in one day but what happened with the first one
16403,I know when Amanda was here you said defecate
16404,it woulduv used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water
16405,your rainbow song was the best part of the show
16406,do you remember where we're gonna go this weekend Honey
16407,she took the training wheels off see she has no little wheels on the back
16408,well this is he's feeding cake to his little animals
16409,and we didn't know how you learned that word
16410,okay let me put you up on the chair
16411,she is hard working and practical and she can cook and sew
16412,since each of its toes were hoofed Machrauchenia would've been able to run quickly to escape predators
16413,she's very caring and heart is full of kindness
16414,maybe that djou think that's the rest of the pterodactyl flying
16415,look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
16416,I am said Snuffy but everyone else picked a favorite color to sing about and I couldn't figure out my favorite color
16417,I think daddy would like to sleep even more than you do
16418,and we didn't know where you got that from and we were laughing and laughing
16419,there's I mean we used to walk down from campus to the inner harbor and definitely you'd like you'd have several blocks where you'd be like hm you know
16420,poor Cinderella is made to work as a servant by her cruel stepmother and her spoiled stepsisters
16421,okay let's see if that fits with the rest of the pterodactyl
16422,choosing a favorite color is one of the hardest things I'd ever tried to do
16423,it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handlebar with the other
16424,and do you remember honey when you were little and your Manuela used to come
16425,and who are we going to see in New York
16426,but she never stops hoping and believing that one day her life will change
16427,hey Snuffy said Jay Jay I have an idea when I have trouble figuring something out I go see Brenda Blue
16428,right one car hit the other car and then the second car hit a third car
16429,xxx she has a friend who has a nanny named Manuela so xxx was always like my Manuela does this and your Manuela does that
16430,we've read Hilda a lot can't we pick a different one that we haven't read in a while
16431,you can have you want me to see if I I don't know if I have any blueberries maybe not
16432,although they are only tiny mice Gus and Jack are Cinderella's loyal friends
16433,that's a great idea thanks Jay Jay called Snuffy
16434,there were lots_of animals that I didn't know of before how bout you
16435,Baltimore reminds me of Providence too because like the lower park area and the east side area like you get these huge houses
16436,they help her with her chores and save her from being lonely mhm
16437,we could put all of them in if we want
16438,he headed toward Terrytown airport and Brenda Blue's workshop
16439,right you hafta be careful not to break your bunny bank you're right
16440,soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
16441,when Snuffy arrived at the workshop he found Brenda Blue working on a small motor
16442,Brontotherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall
16443,daddy has some work too but I think mommy has more
16444,yeah mommy's gonna put some of these chocolate chips in too
16445,hi Brenda said Snuffy hi Snuffy what's wrong asked Brenda
16446,although it looked like a modern day rhinoceros the two animals are only distantly related
16447,well these are all his stuffed animals he was pretending that they were real I think
16448,I can't decide on a favorite color said Snuffy
16449,she was telling the story to xxx and I um but it was very elaborate when she was telling it and I said uh you're such a good storyteller
16450,Brontotherium lived in the warm forest and had a large forked horn on its snout that was shaped like a y do you see its horn
16451,well it seems to me if something is your favorite color you probably see it a lot right asked Brenda
16452,alright we're gonna read our whale wash book
16453,okay so let's see is there can you turn that white piece over over there
16454,afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
16455,and xxx said oh yeah you are and she goes thanks guys
16456,I'm not gonna do my work until Sunday I don't think so
16457,okay see because the whale see how dirty the whale is
16458,yes said Snuffy I would probably see it every day
16459,the fairy godmother makes Cinderella's dreams of happiness come true
16460,yeah here's the y shaped one now up here see
16461,yeah let's see if that one fits over here
16462,so the whale comes in in kind of like a car wash and then these fish clean the whales off
16463,he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
16464,and if something is your favorite you probably like it a lot too right asked Brenda
16465,oh no kidding oh my gosh that's funny
16466,oh you're gonna sing twinkle twinkle little star
16467,Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered then he fell into the flower bed
16468,yes said Snuffy if it's my favorite I'd really love it
16469,whadju say no sir is that what you said
16470,well first we're gonna go to their apartment
16471,he looks like he needs a tooth brushing too doesn't he
16472,I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
16473,so you should figure out your favorite color based on the things you see today explained Brenda
16474,and then we're gonna go with them to their
16475,oh that's okay we'll just put it back
16476,oh my gosh you'll have_to eat all their cake then won't you
16477,she like xxx like these little sort of like weird little idioms and stuff she thinks are so funny and like
16478,and let's see what other stories do we have_to tell Amanda
16479,for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
16480,what a super idea thanks Brenda exclaimed Snuffy as he flew up into the sky
16481,I guess I'll havta do it by myself then won't I
16482,he's going to be at the top of the xxx
16483,it's hard to tell whether it's a velociraptor or a t+rex
16484,he watched as his friends rode off without him
16485,what did we say the other day that you oh I said what's the story morning+glory
16486,do you think the little boys can eat all the cake
16487,but until then he's working at the whale wash
16488,I think it's a t+rex actually because a velociraptor has a really pointy nose
16489,they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
16490,oh my is that what you were looking for
16491,I think it's Sow wait let me check the pronunciation
16492,yyy is whale wash you get a whale of a wash and the price oh my gosh
16493,we will put our dough in this smaller bowl
16494,on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
16495,Snuffy was ready to put his plan into action so he looked at the things around him
16496,is that a bug or is that a toy
16497,you don't like to wear the the birthday hats right that's true
16498,oh my god I was watching some of Lily's
16499,I can't ride without my training wheels said Franklin
16500,the whale wash starts thumping and the soap suds start pumping
16501,three monks Hok Lok and Siew traveled along a mountain road
16502,these are the c_ds of when Jenny takes movies of us when she's here and then she brings us the little movies to play on the computer
16503,did you give it your best effort asked his mother
16504,Cinderella has no money to spend on clothes so her animal friends help her to patch up a simple dress an apron each morning and shine her worn out shoes
16505,the turtles get to work twirling on the wax when Oscar turns up the music with the volume to the max
16506,oh my gosh what's with the bugs in this room
16507,you got uh a lil a spider tattoo on your arm right
16508,they talked about cat whiskers the color of the sun and giving
16509,well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
16510,is that a triceratops I don't know I have_to look because these don't have three horns they just have one and in that big xxx that xxx
16511,she wasn't feeling well was that why she had medicine
16512,but my sky writing smoke is white and so are the clouds so maybe white should be my favorite color
16513,Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he cried
16514,ooh is he dead or is he dying
16515,what makes one happy Siew asked Hok the youngest monk
16516,I was looking at ones of her when she was gosh maybe just two or like year and a half
16517,yummy yummy yummy in your tummy
16518,the eels have the sparks to keep the current glowing
16519,the birds and mice sew frills and bows on an old dress that once belonged to her mother so that Cinderella can go to the ball
16520,old Siew who was the wisest said let's find out
16521,oh see they're lighting up so everyone can see
16522,try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
16523,Matthew has to take some medicine because his ears were hurting him
16524,hey Snuffy called Jay Jay how's it going
16525,ooh you can have a bite of it with your dough
16526,and how old are you gonna be on your birthday
16527,and uh and um Manuela was still here and she was going through the colors with her
16528,I'm still trying to choose my favorite color replied Snuffy
16529,oh that's right she was right she said pretend you have spiders and we did itsy bitsy spider and then we put them in our pockets right
16530,Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
16531,the whales keep on moving through each and every station and the fish crew keeps on cleaning
16532,the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of the village below

16558,but the doctor told me I didn't have any medicine that I just had to wait it out
16559,what is with the bugs in this room huh
16560,oh boy honey you sure set up a nice system for your dinosaurs
16561,it says the giant sloth was truly huge about twenty feet long from nose to tail
16562,while you look at that mommy's just gonna look at the cookies for a minute
16563,I was talking about when you were talking when you were just learning to talk when you were a baby
16564,he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
16565,Jay Jay and Snuffy arrived at farmer Dale's field
16566,once upon a time the manor house was the happiest place in the whole kingdom
16567,each time she got_to the third rung she fell to the sand below
16568,the scrubbers fall in line dancing side by side
16569,as they sprayed water on the crops Snuffy was thinking about what his favorite color might be
16570,let's see this one says we're strange creatures
16571,but when Cinderella's mean stepmother arrived things changed
16572,picking up the groove and scrubbing as they glide
16573,mm parts of the field are brown so maybe brown should be my favorite color
16574,Lady Chrimain made Cinderella sleep in the attic and do chores all day
16575,did you tell Amanda do you remember when I lost my voice
16576,the woolly mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair
16577,the crabs leap from bungee cords snapping with their claws removing all the barnacles from the whales' scaly jaws
16578,let's see that maybe goes oh wait let me turn the oven off
16579,my fever did go away after I took my medicine right
16580,and the corn stalks are green so maybe green should be my favorite color
16581,I am going to get your book and look
16582,why do we keep finding dying bugs in that room
16583,but when the corn is picked it's yellow just like the sun that's two votes for yellow so maybe that should be my favorite color
16584,and the funny thing is she's gone through things where she'll become really obsessed with some field of study and at that point she must have been two or just like two and a quarter or something like that
16585,that one says the wooly hair has the woolly mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall
16586,you're you're right on the lobster and the crab at the supermarket
16587,you took it off the vacuum cleaner right
16588,the next time we go to bread and circus we havta get some more okay
16589,okay Snuffy said Jay Jay we have a lot of deliveries to make we'd better head back to Terrytown airport to refuel
16590,inside the xxx the whale's mouth is dirty and green and slimy
16591,this one says the saber+tooth tiger has long pointy fangs
16592,so Oscar works his magic to make it nice and shiny
16593,let's go back here cranky girl who didn't have a nap
16594,back at Terrytown airport Brenda Blue filled up their gas tanks
16595,and she had a place mat with all with the United States and

16603,thanks Brenda called Jay Jay and Snuffy as they left the airport
16604,ooh you're gonna go to the supermarket
16605,the Brontotherium says that the Brontotherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees
16606,he keeps the music pumping while Oscar turns it loose
16607,boy that Brenda Blue sure is a big help said Snuffy
16608,every morning Cinderella feeds the animals before she takes breakfast to her stepmother in bed

16610,mm I don't know that has a very funny head we're gonna hafta check your book for that one
16611,the Thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet

16625,here's what I would like from the supermarket
16626,yeah do you know what the building is called
16627,mm that is yeah that guy with the funny head though we havta to look that up
16628,the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below
16629,we probably don't even know that many now right
16630,I would like I think I would like some pears
16631,beef stew you know what it's such a warm day and beef stew it should be colder to make beef stew because it takes a long time to make and it gets the kitchen very hot
16632,it says that the Machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps
16633,so she'll go through things where she'll know like xxx
16634,I have been very into pears recently
16635,yeah we're gonna just ignore that camera okay
16636,do you know where Grandma xxx told me that she and Papa xxx were going
16637,I never ate pears before and I've been eating them nonstop
16638,should I tell you what my favorite foods are
16639,it says owl's on the night shift because the owl stays awake at night when everyone else is asleep
16640,sure we'll look and see if we have it we'll read it okay
16641,are you a regular doctor or are you a dentist
16642,the Brontotherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns
16643,I never was really a pear person before
16644,I'm gonna hide this one in your shirt
16645,a little magic is all Cinderella needs to find happiness
16646,yeah that'd be fun it's very far away
16647,when you were a little tiny lil tiny teeny tiny girl you used to read that book all the time and you could read that book to me
16648,she has charm and beauty and all the elegance of a princess
16649,whada you think daddy's favorite foods are
16650,how bout you wanna try one and see if you love them which I think you will
16651,and with a little help from her fairy godmother her dreams come true
16652,this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures that roamed the earth many many years ago
16653,I could look in the freezer I think I might have some chicken in the freezer
16654,I don't know where the corn went that's a good question
16655,oh you're a regular dentist okay so you're taking care of my teeth huh
16656,to celebrate the prince's return all eligible ladies in the land are invited to attend a ball at the castle
16657,my name is Becky and I live near the New_York public library
16658,really none of us have any favorite foods that's so sad
16659,well but you memorized the whole book because I used to read it to you all the time and you would every time I would turn the page you would read the book
16660,it says the woolly mammoth had pretty small ears
16661,oh you're gonna roll around that auto person
16662,yeah but she'll be like oh I you know every other kid will be like I speak seven languages
16663,mm I don't think that goes there sweets
16664,but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important
16665,that says that the woolly mammoth lived during the Ice_Age
16666,yeah I bet it is he does all the houses in the area every time you hear a lawnmower it's Manny
16667,well they are so jealous of Cinderella that they tear her outfit to pieces
16668,we should go to the library next time we're in
16669,oh your hair looks so pretty and you have a beautiful ribbon in it too
16670,I thought that I saw some corn between the two couches in the living room
16671,she'll be like I speak English slang English colloquial English
16672,I don't know if you remember it now we'll havta look for it
16673,it says that one of the saber+tooth tigers was called a Smiladon
16674,but with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother ensures that Cinderella can go to the ball
16675,it's like walking up the steps of a palace especially if you walk exactly in the middle
16676,didjou tell Amanda what you like to eat on toast with bananas
16677,it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long
16678,he could eat the chicken salad but not the lettuce salad right
16679,oh my gosh they're all going in the great valley
16680,we can probably do three in Spanish whatever Dora teaches you
16681,Olivia you're right we haven't read that in a while
16682,the library was my favorite place in New_York when we first moved here
16683,maybe I'll read it once and then you can read it once
16684,from the all the fuzzy stuff that fell from the tree
16685,oh can I lie down on your pile of pillows
16686,the emu is kind of like a sort of like an ostrich a little bit
16687,where's your little oh Debbie was here Honey and I had to give her something then I forgot
16688,what else could we put if we make chicken salad what could we put in it
16689,as soon as their eyes meet at the ball Cinderella and the prince fall in love
16690,she is very good at wearing people out
16691,she's an artist and she painted all the other pictures too
16692,while he was flying Snuffy thought to himself I love making deliveries so what colors do I see when I'm making them
16693,xxx just gotta push that away now you can look for the triceratops body
16694,hm let's look in the fridge and see what we have that maybe we could put into our chicken salad
16695,Manny's much better with that than Mommy is
16696,alright you gonna go searching for the corn
16697,but when the clock strikes mid uh midnight Cinderella leaves her glass slipper behind on the stairs in a hurry to leave before the magic ends
16698,okay got a lot of pillows here to lie on
16699,she said that once a week we could go wherever I wanted to
16700,and the other funny thing about Lily when she was doing all her states is she would only look at the um map of the United States upside down
16701,actually you were little I think you got Daisy when you were
16702,oh my the pheasant is dancing with the sting ray
16703,the Brontotherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout
16704,for my first expedition I wanted to see real animals
16705,yeah let me just stick the rest of the cookies in the oven
16706,okay well Mommy's not hungry right now so I won't
16707,yeah daddy's on the other side of the toast what
16708,we would give it to her right side up and she would say no it's upside down and she would turn it over
16709,the Thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings
16710,xxx excuse me wow that's great and what do the two of you do together
16711,finding a zoo on the map was easy
16712,and the flowers of Smiley Meadow are purple and orange
16713,and the grand duke is absolutely delighted when Cinderella produces the matching glass slipper and puts it on her dainty foot
16714,sometimes Ian just won't leave her alone so Olivia has to be firm
16715,these green beans are not looking so good
16716,knowing where I was on the map and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder
16717,what are you gonna buy at the supermarket that we can have for dinner
16718,because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs
16719,the green one and the red one I don't know
16720,so do you like to read books in the library
16721,the deliveries took them over the docks of Terrytown and Snuffy looked again for his favorite color
16722,do you wanna throw it away or should I throw it away
16723,he doesn't know what to do with the balloons
16724,Sweetie then you'll have_to wait till later because I'm not hungry now
16725,you are silly should we look at our states
16726,but I finally figured it out by turning the map
16727,you sure have led a charmed life haven't you
16728,Winnie the Pooh woke up in the middle of the night and listened
16729,wow look at those boats one's pink one's black another is gold
16730,after all his searching Prince Charming has at last found the beautiful girl he danced with at the ball and the whole kingdom rejoices when he marries Cinderella
16731,once the map and I were both facing the same direction finding the zoo was easy
16732,look at all those raccoons blowing up balloons
16733,Olivia lives with her mother her father her brother her dog Perry and Edwin the cat
16734,Honey I'm not hungry would you like some peach yogurt then
16735,oh that's very nice it's very nice to share books because books are so great
16736,and I think it was Tigger who says something like
16737,what are you thinking about Snuffy asked Jay Jay
16738,I havta write an article for your school newsletter what would be a fun thing to write about for your school newsletter
16739,wow we got a big meal goin on here don't we
16740,huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue
16741,no sometimes when we go out to dinner mommy eats all the crusty bread and you get to eat the soft inside right
16742,I'm still trying to figure out my favorite color
16743,one good thing about New_York is that most of the streets are numbered in order
16744,Sweetie I'll share it with you later but I already had breakfast and I'm not hungry now
16745,what d'you have there do you have the block with the water in it
16746,oh do you think he has to go to the dentist and have the dentist put his teeth back in
16747,it's an old green bean I'll go throw it away yucky
16748,but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult
16749,well maybe you'll get lucky and it will come to like a flash of lightning said Jay Jay
16750,huh you know what might be interesting actually
16751,the numbers go up as you go north and down as you go south
16752,what do you like to have for breakfast with the beast belle
16753,hm do you remember what it's called that funny hat
16754,just then there was a flash of light and a rumbling sound in the sky
16755,perhaps now's a good time to explain the Atkins diet to you honey
16756,well it is great but what do you think I should write about should I write is there something that you like I could write a little thing about
16757,I think yeah we have oh let's see what's in here
16758,I know I was going the right way because the numbers kept going up
16759,do you have plain cereal or do you have milk in your cereal
16760,she is thoughtful and unspoiled and always willing to help
16761,we have a little chicken tikka sauce and I wonder if we could make a vinaigrette out of this although this sauce does not excite me so much but we could probably do that right
16762,and it's true I mean I remember as a uh I would I used to eat my mom would pack me and this was like first and second grade I was older than she was
16763,although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons
16764,she is a romantic and believes her dreams of love will one day come true
16765,Sweetie I already told you I'd have two bites
16766,sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them but at this one most of the animals aren't in cages
16767,Naima where are the legos can you give me a lego
16768,and let's see do you remember this big one over here
16769,the sky filled with clouds and the rain began to fall
16770,he wears pants to work yes he does
16771,her favorite things includes singing her voice is sweet and pure and she loves to sing to the animals in the forest
16772,the giant sloth probably only became extinct about eleven million years ago
16773,don't you think the Spinosaurus goes there near that red piece
16774,a half of baloney sandwich with the crust cut off it was like this big
16775,okay but then I changed my mind and said I'd have two bites right
16776,as Snuffy and Jay Jay flew back to Terrytown airport they got all wet but they knew when they arrived Brenda Blue would be waiting with a dry towel
16777,right those are the little Swifts the little birds
16778,the penguins have rocks to climb on and make their nests with and a pool to swim in
16779,let's try let's see if this one goes up the rest of his body
16780,we could write something together we could talk about why you like school so much
16781,you know what on his belt it's called a buckle
16782,you're gonna go to the swim club wow
16783,I I wear a dress and a skirt to dance in
16784,I was like ooh I can't finish it all
16785,let's go look in a couple of cookbooks and see we could do I feel like we have peanut sauce a lot
16786,let's see what else do you remember this one above Florida right above Florida
16787,you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water
16788,mm yeah they're they're a different kind of bird you're right
16789,how are you feeling Snuffy asked Brenda as she finished drying him off
16790,who did we see who used to be wearing a red wig
16791,well it says that lots_of interesting creatures roamed the earth millions of years ago
16792,they were my favorites but I also liked watching the insects
16793,a like McDonald's hamburger oh forget it I could never finish one it was like there's too much meat
16794,who used to wear a red wig who took it off
16795,I thought you wanted to give it to me
16796,oh well this is the husk of the corn we don't really eat this
16797,I saw a leaf cutter ant bite off a leaf and carry it all the way back to its nest
16798,good I wouldn't want you to get rusty she said
16799,is that the rest of the Spinosaurus's body I think
16800,he's a funny animal he looks what does he look like to you that tapir
16801,they were the predecessors to lots_of the animals that we see today
16802,really what does a princess do all day
16803,what're you doing are you hiding
16804,I'll give you a hint you know who lives here
16805,Snuffy moved to the hanger door and noticed a rainbow he remembered he hadn't picked a favorite color
16806,what was your favorite thing at the zoo do you remember
16807,looks a little bit like an elephant and a little bit like a hippo doesn't he
16808,let me look and see what money I have_to put in Sugar xxx
16809,the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below
16810,I'm just coming in oh no look we're in here
16811,Alaska is actually over here which is really Alaska's really up here but it didn't fit in the map so they put it down here
16812,Brenda said I should think of something I love and that might help me choose
16813,they could not see from so high above that the village had been through many hard times
16814,wasn't there a polar bear named Lily
16815,famine floods and war had made the villagers weary and untrusting of strangers
16816,in fact Brenda's one of the most helpful people I know
16817,mm I don't know does she like to sing about the trees and the flowers
16818,and what does the big blue bug have on have on his back
16819,hey honey maybe you wanna sing the Aunt_Leoni song for Amanda
16820,they had even become suspicious of their neighbors
16821,no sweetie mommy's sitting down right now you can get blankie if you want

16827,we'll see if we can find anything that jogs our imagination
16828,you know what sweetie I don't think we should throw that in the house because it could hit something and break something
16829,okay here look that might be the rest of his tail
16830,there was a farmer a tea merchant a scholar a seamstress a doctor a carpenter and many others
16831,I think I have a few pieces of money in here
16832,what would be a good article about what do you think is fun about school

16860,ooh some brown speckles let's see where could that go
16861,don't think so what animal I think we missed a page

16863,well I don't know whada you think of curry dressing
16864,the horse went up and down when the music started
16865,last summer when Olivia was little her mother showed her how to make sand castles

16888,we don't usually have curry chicken salad that could be exciting I think right
16889,tomorrow we're supposed to go to the play+ground for a big school picnic
16890,on rainy days Olivia likes to go to the museum
16891,these people do not know happiness they all agreed

16905,Flora Fauna and Merryweather love Briar Rose dearly and have special plans for her birthday

16907,they gathered twigs and branches and made a fire
16908,let me know if you need me to bring anything I'd be happy to do so
16909,but there's one painting Olivia just doesn't get I could do that in about five minutes she says to her mother

16917,let's go check and see if we can see any birds
16918,not too much Lily's having her Brown study now so
16919,well abstract painting means that not everyone agrees what it's a picture of
16920,are you gonna have a theme of any kind

16928,I was out running and I seem to have lost them

16930,my mother said they had the best cheesecake in New_York
16931,well you're gonna come with Mommy to the wine store we hafta get some wine

16945,well wine is made out of the grapes they squish the grapes to make the wine
16946,wow which state do you think it's a picture of
16947,as she started to take her pot her mother asked what she was doing
16948,I know one person actually grew up in Iowa and we know scary

16962,as soon as she gets home Olivia gives it a try
16963,I get it said Jay Jay he sees you every day he loves you a lot and without you none of the things he does would be possible
16964,as smoke drifted up the neighbors peered out from their windows
16965,Malificent's curse comes true when Aurora pricks her finger on a spinning wheel and falls into a deep sleep
16966,oh no she's painting on the wall that is a very big no no
16967,a fire and a huge pot in the middle of the village was a true curiosity

16998,but I love you anyway and Olivia gives her a kiss back and says I love you anyway too
16999,you're gonna tire yourself out carrying that around
17000,oh I thought we were gonna sleep next to each other and put blankie over us
17001,as far as Aurora is concerned her life has been uneventful
17002,last time we had soup stones of this size and color carrots made the broth very sweet
17003,oh she probably thinks I know xxx she probably thinks Mama's really smart
17004,for sixteen years she has lived in the forest longing for excitement and romance
17005,let's see you know what let's get that end piece there with the sky
17006,here's some toys you haven't seen for a few days
17007,xxx and a picture of you with xxx when you were really little
17008,carrots said the woman said a woman from the back I may have a few carrots
17009,you can see where kamikaze planes crashed into it
17010,Honey do you think the words are written here or do you think Mommy's just super smart and knows all her states
17011,you can tell Amanda all the different Care_Bears if you want
17012,you could probably put that right up there
17013,but then on her sixteenth birthday everything seems to happen at once
17014,do you know anyone else who has bunk beds
17015,the fighter jets are real too you can climb up platforms and look inside them
17016,but she returned with as many carrots as she could carry carry as she dropped them into the pot
17017,that's stuck that looks like it's stuck
17018,you know what sweetie I think I need you to come with me to Home Depot later
17019,I'm sure we have some other errands to run

17022,okay I'm gonna put these in the fridge for now we can try them later okay
17023,it was a very cold windy day and we had the whole huge deck almost to ourselves
17024,and she has like some jewelry and a crown on too I think
17025,and what about the how does the baby bird song start again sweetie because Amanda doesn't know that one
17026,do you think it would be better with onions asked Hok
17027,Martin ran around acting and sounding like a plane until other people came out so then we went inside
17028,Alec has a double stroller you're right
17029,ah I think she's getting undressed and she's dancing
17030,oh they're all there's gifts all over the floor
17031,oh yes maybe an onion would taste good said a farmer and he hurried off
17032,and oh we skipped a page didn't we
17033,we got_to work the controls in the simulated cockpit with pilot and copilot seats
17034,he got a little truck he got a car he got a baseball he got a baseball mitt he's opening another box
17035,you hafta tell me how the first line goes cus I don't remember
17036,you know Mommy and Daddy went to Idaho once they went hot air ballooning
17037,when the fairies find Aurora asleep they know that king and queen will be heartbroken
17038,oh that's too bad you'll need to stay on the couch forever
17039,he returned in a moment with five big onions and he dropped them into the bubbling soup
17040,oh I was wondering where this was
17041,honey what's that piece that's upside down next to you
17042,alright mommy's gonna try them and I'll tell you if I think they're delicious okay and if they're delicious then maybe you'll wanna try them right
17043,ah these pages kept getting ripped we had to keep taping them and taping them
17044,wow it's first rate suspense scary and stylish
17045,mommy has to put some nail polish on honey do you wanna put nail polish on
17046,look at that do you remember what the name of that building is
17047,well they'll be so sad if she doesn't wake up but when Philip kisses Aurora Malificent's curse is broken and she wakes up from her sleep
17048,nope there's a piece that's white that's upside down right there
17049,you know didn't Elmo go in a hot air balloon when you get in a little basket and it goes up up up up up
17050,the villagers all nodded their heads as the smell was very agreeable
17051,aha there you go you wanna put that in
17052,but if only we had some mushrooms said Siew rubbing his chin
17053,the next week we went to the observation deck of the Empire state building
17054,can you untangle that because I don't want that to break
17055,maybe we should call daddy and ask him what he would like if he would like curry chicken salad or if he would like uh well I tell you what first mommy is gonna go let me put our cookie dough in the fridge
17056,a few dashed away and returned with fresh mushrooms noodles pea pods and carrots
17057,xxx I think you should try that you want me to show you pictures of it I have pictures of it when we went
17058,we stepped onto it just at that magical moment when the city and bridge lights are on but the sky still has some of the sunset in it and it's not quite dark
17059,oh alright another book that we haven't read in a while
17060,I think I'll put paper on lids too
17061,it was very fun Mommy thought it was more fun than Daddy
17062,something magical began to happen among the villagers
17063,and let me get the chicken out of the freezer
17064,look I'll make a little oh you took my eye
17065,yeah doesn't it is it all dried out
17066,in the painting we are looking north with the Hudson river on our left and the East river on our right
17067,as each person opened their heart to give the next person gave even more
17068,sometimes mommy writes in her school books right but generally only in school books if the teacher tells you to right
17069,you know it was really because I'm not like I never go on rollercoaster rides or anything like that
17070,and as this happened the soup grew richer and smelled more delicious
17071,the small green square in the distance is Central park
17072,I think when it gets warmer out daddy's gonna havta put new sand in the sandbox because I bet the old sand is dirty
17073,let me go get our chicken I'll be right up
17074,I imagine the emperor would suggest we had dumplings said one villager
17075,right because we don't draw in our picture books
17076,um I don't like drops and you know like but it's so gradual like going up and across and down and you just feel like
17077,yeah mommy has to take her medicine because I am still very stuffy
17078,are you gonna hold it you havta hold it near your mouth so you can talk into it
17079,what about cloud ear and mung beans and yams cried some others
17080,apparently she's been siphoning coffee out of the kitchen
17081,wow you have a lotta books for school honey
17082,and taro root and winter melon and baby corn cried the other villagers
17083,well you just feel like I guess the physics of it because like the heat rises and whatever that it's so simple that unless like you know some flying knife comes out and hits your balloon like that there's just not that much that can go assuming you're not because they do weather reporting so you're not gonna get hopefully caught in a thunderstorm or whatever
17084,this is Lulu's hello come in says Lulu
17085,Martin's mother was curious about these expeditions of ours so for our next one we went to Wall street where she works

17112,it's called um Yellowstone and they have all this bubbling
17113,we're gonna have_to move this xxx somewhere further up
17114,maybe when we go to frog and toad we'll go to the bakery across the street
17115,actually who used to work on Wall street
17116,Lulu's family has three pets a puppy a bunny and a fish
17117,there's all the penguins they're jumping into the water
17118,they have all this bubbling mud that they call the paint pots and it just sits in the ground and bubbles really it's hot

17125,now the chicks are all alone chicks what do they say
17126,roosters are boys chickens are girls
17127,and it makes noises and it's smelly
17128,we could read another one of your princess books
17129,in the federal hall national memorial museum behind the statue I learned
17130,how good it would taste how giving the villagers had become
17131,well because it's um sulfur smells like rotten eggs
17132,the sea they're going swimming to look for food
17133,you could get maybe you could get like a muffin or a cookie
17134,and look and so acidic it burned a hole right through the street
17135,no don't throw the ball in here sweetie because I don't want anything to break
17136,they brought rice and steamed buns they brought lychee nuts and sweet cakes they brought tea to drink and they lit lanterns
17137,look there's Daddy he's saying P U it smells
17138,this is Lulu's best friend they blow beautiful bubbles
17139,I know I xxx well first you think to yourself like what's really the difference between the chocolate chip cookie and say like a banana chocolate chip muffin right
17140,no she's gotta see how much I weigh right
17141,this is Lulu's grandma Lulu likes snack time at grandma's
17142,maybe later we'll go and get some bread for dinner we'll get a nice fresh bread with our chicken salad
17143,they had not been together for a feast like this for as long as anyone could remember
17144,let me go walk over and stand on the scale
17145,sorry but she doesn't twirl if she's not on there right
17146,oh my gosh you put a telescope on his head
17147,after the banquet they told stories they sang songs and they celebrated long into the night
17148,but best of all Lulu loves her family and they all love her
17149,does it really matter if you have a chocolate chip cookies at ten o'clock in the morning
17150,look there's the basket for the hot air balloon see
17151,then they unlocked their doors and took the monks into their homes and gave them very comfortable places to sleep
17152,do you see peacocks where do you see peacocks
17153,xxx let's see okay you should see how tall I am how tall am I
17154,where oh where could you have put that piece of puzzle
17155,in the gentle spring morning everyone gathered together near the willows to say farewell
17156,Ariel's best friend is a little fish named
17157,you know what we should do when mommy was little I used to have a book about William
17158,thank you for having us as your guests said the monks you have been most generous
17159,okay I think the doctor has to look at my eyes
17160,that's right you do see the horses at polo
17161,thank you said the villagers with the gifts you have given we will always have plenty
17162,I should grandma Rosie and papa Jay back and tell them that they should look for that book right
17163,where are you going where you staying in here green room living room
17164,well we finished Sleeping Beauty now we're reading about Ariel
17165,you have shown us that sharing makes us all richer
17166,oh hot springs you can but those are all like a hundred and five to a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit
17167,after that we took the subway to my favorite toystore F_A_O_Schwartz
17168,let's go over there and see what you were looking at
17169,and to think said the monks being happy is as simple as making stone soup
17170,they have more stuffed animals than I'd ever seen in my life
17171,she's also really funny too because I have a tendency to um like I'll put a c_d in the car and I'll listen to it for like a week straight I'll just keep that c_d in
17172,and I think um like when we went to Yellowstone they said someone actually some kid wandered off into Old Faithful or something and it set off
17173,and they really are as big as my mother has painted them
17174,stone soup has its traditional roots in European folklore but there are many versions of the story
17175,she let Martin and me paint ourselves into this picture

17830,yeah and what did you say about the one named Hope
17831,well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here
17832,Gaspard and Lisa please try to stay out of trouble our teacher said as we got on the bus
17833,so this transmitter itself is not the problem
17834,you said I think she she said you said I think that's a good name I think she's hoping for a friend
17835,okay I'm gonna run out of these very soon
17836,I just heard the noise of the car coming back
17837,on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits that we should see
17838,are you sure is it empty check all the pockets
17839,mm I think I'll put this cereal in some yogurt
17840,and what else does mommy like to look at at the museum
17841,Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us
17842,on the receiver from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver
17843,well everything has got the k everything's got the k
17844,what's one of mommy's favorite things at the museum
17845,tooth teeth no what was he doing
17846,no okay let's find some things to put in it
17847,Daddy was shopping he was looking for coffee
17848,you were sitting in a big girl chair eating yogurt weren't you
17849,when're you gonna learn how to say Daddy
17850,the museum was very interesting our teacher showed us everything
17851,and the other transmitter is still also off so
17852,he might have found some yeah I hear that noise too
17853,djou remember which dinosaur had the two thousand teeth which dinosaur had all those teeth
17854,butterflies monkey tigers elephants and even the skeleton of a whale
17855,oh I have_to okay here's s'more pieces I'm gonna have_to cut s'more up
17856,you having trouble getting that out that's because I put it in the zipper compartment
17857,and what else do you like to look at that's very very big
17858,but the exhibit of extinct animals was the most exciting
17859,I don't remember it was a duck+bill dinosaur we just read about it yesterday
17860,don't even try to walk in the wrong direction or she'll melt down
17861,if you can hear me now then then what then it makes no difference whether the other transmitter is turned off on the receiver
17862,he has a letter c on his hat you're right
17863,it's still gonna take anything that's heart shaped takes a while though to make because we have_to put it in the refrigerator to chill
17864,ooh you know it's chilly out today you can wear your new boots
17865,there's a spoon here with some cereal and some raisin on it would you like this
17866,yes maybe later you want to show Jenny your squishy pillow
17867,okay well we're done with the beans anyway
17868,Anatasaurus that's what it was you're right
17869,I think she thinks I'm not sure I think she's using slowly for anytime something gets off of something
17870,well why don't we put it right over here
17871,I'm gonna give you some rice now okay
17872,mm+kay after we read the book I'll go get it
17873,so that way if she wants to make an announcement she can stand behind it and she can say hello
17874,those are extinct animals which means they lived a very long time ago
17875,I know then how about we don't make heart shaped cookies because anything we hafta cut out with cookie cutters
17876,because I just I just knocked the car of this and she kinda muttered to herself slowly
17877,hah let's see my parents like the temple of Dendoor best you walk right up to it and see the hieroglyphics on the walls and graffiti that the original explorers wrote there too
17878,maybe there's a song about a princess you would like to sing
17879,he has three teeth because you're three years old
17880,play with the blocks oh good yes let's play with the blocks
17881,oh you know what that's not a horn that's a telescope
17882,and do you think the Buddah is a girl or a boy
17883,it looks like Gaspard and Lisa doesn't it
17884,hm whada you eat with those big sharp teeth
17885,okay but that's why it takes a long time to make them Baby Cakes
17886,but I like the sacred animals and the little charms like the turquoise hippopotamus what's his name
17887,I think I'm gonna put the frog underneath the block
17888,are you gonna are you going to get off slowly
17889,that's what it is she's looking out to see out into the water
17890,the transmitter which is on f one right now
17891,here's a spoon that has more rice on it
17892,Gaspard and Lisa our classmates joked you look like extinct animals
17893,Lily said to me is the Buddah a girl or boy and I said I think it's a boy and she said no I think it's a girl and I said really why do you think that
17894,and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem
17895,that's so silly Mommy didn't realize it's a telescope
17896,do you think that it's that they did it yesterday or it's been
17897,I didn't even tell you what we were doing yet
17898,there's no back to it though so you have_to be extra careful
17899,is it called there's a t+rex in my bed
17900,now this should be fine cause I just tested it
17901,everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea
17902,what if we do chocolate dough with white chocolate chips or something
17903,the turquoise hippo that protected a person in his next life from being attacked by real hippos
17904,member we saw the juggler the other day
17905,I got you a big box of fruit roll ups
17906,xxx this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery
17907,Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan
17908,he was good I don't know how to do it do do do
17909,and she said because I think she's sitting and thinking about her boyfriend
17910,they have lots_of other things in the Met it's huge but my mother believes that you enjoy museums more if you don't try to see too much on one visit
17911,but I did just change the battery so it has a second new battery which may have been the problem
17912,first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars
17913,Daddy ordered me to stay away from the humans but I told him I couldn't do that
17914,alright Lily Mommy's not gonna make cookies with you at all if all you're gonna do is moan
17915,do we have anything else that makes noise that we could shake
17916,we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues
17917,and if you can hear this it's definitely fine
17918,he lowered his trident and with a single blast destroyed all of my human treasures
17919,the next week we took the subway up a hundred and twenty fifth street in Harlem
17920,I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice
17921,then why don't we do these Honey because these we don't have_to wait for we can make them right away

17939,I had heard horrible stories about the sea witch but I was so upset I didn't care
17940,some I'm doing some with it plugged into one socket and some I'm gonna tape some plugged into another socket so they can see because I think that's that's what the issue is
17941,okay we'll do hearts but it's gonna take a while

17961,did you know broccoli used to be your favorite food
17962,been sitting here on the floor for two days so it can't be that critical

18184,I watched as Eric and Vanessa's wedding ship sailed into the distance
18185,yeah clean is the opposite of dirty that's right
18186,the manager said that Thanksgiving is the most popular day for weddings and feasts
18187,is that what you wanna do or do you want something different
18188,throwing things off the side here's s'more food
18189,but Scuttle flew over and said I saw the bride in the mirror Vanessa is Ursula in disguise
18190,xxx cat's name is Fifi except that's just his nickname his real name is Angus
18191,Chinatown is crowded with brides in beautiful dresses
18192,I'll trade you my kelp sandwich for your algae pizza he said to Tad
18193,whoa you hafta keep your lil microphone ball on your shirt otherwise we won't be able to hear you
18194,I liked Chinatown there were so many food smells and all the telephone booths had roofs like little temples
18195,and look on that page there's a fly and a duck
18196,now I understood Ursula had tricked Eric into marrying her
18197,yeah we're gonna go to music class today
18198,I wish Martin could have come though he would have liked seeing the live lobsters on the sidewalk
18199,look Amanda's showing you there's a bumble oh my gosh
18200,while Flounder pulled me onto the ship Scuttle and some other sea creatures swam ahead and interrupted the wedding dropping things on Vanessa and spraying her with water
18201,didjou know that Jane has a little has a big girl like you and two little baby boys
18202,wool you think that's funny it's wool fuzz from the rug

18210,yeah that's the big fat bumble bee that mommy was looking for
18211,everyone had fun playing hide and seek but then Sandy Plankton got in a bit of trouble
18212,you like to see the other babies don't you
18213,Scuttle snatched the necklace from Vanessa which fell to the ground and shattered and my voice flowed back to me
18214,it's like my dad always says says Nemo it's all fun and games until someone gets stuck in a giant clam
18215,that's so funny it was caught in there and I was like oh my gosh caught and I told Don and then later that day he was like I think I found it in the basement
18216,Martin's mother did let him come to the New_York city marathon
18217,so you know how to jump do you know how to clap your hands
18218,I'm pouring you the water right now I had to wash the cup
18219,and Jane has two little baby boys that she had at the same time she had two little babies in her tummy at the same time
18220,oh that's a good idea to take them off before you go to bed
18221,and as loudly as I could I yelled Eric
18222,did xxx did you hear me screaming from the shower that I forgot again
18223,we held a sign for the gallery that shows my mother's paintings
18224,you do like to see the babies and then the teacher's name is miss xxx

18227,where's your belly button I just saw that belly button
18228,you're the one said Eric it was you all the time
18229,it's so sad that you will actually witness the demise of a person's mind right in front of you like I've reached eighty at thirty three and it's really
18230,well Mommy doesn't really like the music class either but we're gonna go today so we can see the other babies and so we can shake the eggs
18231,because the owner was one of the runners

18253,we seem to have some smoke coming up over here why don't you move out of the way
18254,you wanna give me a piece give me give me a piece
18255,yeah and we said byebye to him cause he ran away fast
18256,I might be willing to make an exchange Ursula said and Daddy agreed and took my place as Ursula's slave
18257,oh Sweetie Pie you know Mommy wants to relax you've been jumping on me all morning and it's tired me out
18258,are there there are stairs in the music class

18275,weeks before Thanksgiving the Christmas decorations go up and the radio city Christmas spectacular opens

18277,I don't think think that bumble bee has the ability to get out of this house
18278,there's the letter what letter is that oh that's the letter a

18282,so sad you threw the backpack and now it's crying

18285,still looking at that picture that's a dog wearing a jacket
18286,Daddy has to get on the phone to answer the beeper
18287,they played some music and then the orchestra went back into the floor and out came the Rockettes
18288,but while I distracted Ursula Eric grabbed the wheel of the ship and steered the bow right into Ursula's cold heart
18289,another one I put all the other letters away

18423,where do they live the grandmas and grandpas
18424,usually I'm excited about what I'm getting but this year I'm more excited about what I'm giving other people
18425,of course my sister Adda is actually queen right now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
18426,you getting ready to go out combing your hair

18431,and then this gets clipped just like Mommy's
18432,Mommy was not paying attention to the clock
18433,it's kind of a tired horsy sound
18434,when you're messy like that baby we see in the book
18435,Mommy was just having fun having breakfast with you
18436,but then your next class is on Wednesday and Mommy is the duty parent Wednesday so we have_to pick a snack
18437,where do the grandmas and grandpas live
18438,one night Harold got up made sure there was a moon so he wouldn't see things in the dark
18439,you're right Adda was princess too and then there was a queen right
18440,yeah you got this stuff all in your eyes
18441,maybe we could roll things and knock other things down with them

18443,yeah we're gonna pick a snack together see what your friends would like
18444,on the ticket I made for Martin I drew people skating and the Prometheus statue and wrote admit one student to skating in Rockefeller center
18445,don't get me wrong I like being a princess but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troupe than perform royal duties
18446,he wondered about the things people see in the dark and where they came from
18447,drink your coffee Daddy so she can see you drinking coffee
18448,we signed up for this ballet class at the J C C with this friend of Lily's but they didn't tell and the class is all for like three year olds and stuff
18449,I'm blowing all these bubbles and you're just ignoring them
18450,we saw the new year start together on the roof deck
18451,kissy kissy kissy kissy
18452,he was glad he couldn't see them in the moonlight
18453,and put it in the tofu and the spaghetti spaghetti foe feti

18456,good job going to the library now let's close the door
18457,and besides Adda is a good queen even though she worries a lot
18458,suddenly he realized he didn't see anything at all in the moonlight there was nothing to see
18459,and then I'm gonna give you a washcloth you can chew on
18460,the wheel the wheel oh I don't know if I can hey you're guy is still stuck in this
18461,and we get in the class and the and I've taken a class with her there before where you know you just sit there and the kids are doing their thing and the teacher was like and it's in like a room with the door closed

18463,and you're gonna have a bite of cereal
18464,you want cheese you were spitting that cheese out silly
18465,I'll have_to look at the list and see who the first duty parent is
18466,when she was a queen in training she used to get upset over everything
18467,but luckily he had brought his purple crayon and he knew where to find water on the desert
18468,that's okay you don't have_to be scared of it
18469,um no I guess we'll see it tomorrow Daisy's mom should will probably bring it with her
18470,you know what the yellow one is above Rhode Island

18472,as the ball dropped everyone sang Auld_Lang_Syne and we did too

18474,there was always a pool of it somewhere near a palm tree
18475,and she's like parents aren't allowed in
18476,it's a sparrow it's a kind of a bird
18477,oh you're giving Daddy the coffee filter in that picture aren't you

18480,oh what're they going to do at the library
18481,I we can't seem to find the cover for it
18482,there's nothing like drinking nice cool water on a desert
18483,like I put her in I left I hear screaming screaming
18484,but there isn't much else to do on a desert
18485,cause I sorta thought she was asking
18486,are they going to pick out books at the library
18487,I go back in I sit for a little bit I leave screaming screaming
18488,I felt excited and proud to be right in the middle of it
18489,oh Daddy said he dropped a piece the other day here
18490,I'm standing close to the camera and Naima is
18491,Harold realized as he looked around except maybe play in the sand
18492,I'm gonna give you some right now there's some rice
18493,like Lily's friend said and you know they're all in little leotards and tights and everything and her friend said that she had to go to the bathroom and the woman was like you're supposed to go to the bathroom before you go to class
18494,so now that you've seen my New_York use the map and have fun exploring your New_York
18495,then we're gonna get in the chair and have a real breakfast in a few minutes
18496,I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna talk at the same volume
18497,okay I'm gonna see if the wheel will go up the slide well it won't go up the slide der
18498,then he remembered how the government has fun on the desert
18499,what were you saying when you were patting patting my head just now
18500,yeah you're giving Daddy the coffee filter holder in that picture
18501,well actually maybe we could roll things and they could go into this
18502,we're gonna be back in New_York next month Honey so you should think about what you wanna see
18503,talking at the same volume and if you can't hardly hear me it's because my

18505,grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
18506,doing train are you playing with the train

18509,they barely left us enough food for ourselves in the winter
18510,hey this is yours this picture of the flowers

18517,now my friend Flik he is a really cool guy
18518,um and uh and then she like points the other three year old to the bathroom and she's like there it is
18519,he is an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
18520,I don't think you would hear that if it was only the camera and my mic
18521,oh here how about your little duck sponge should I take it outta here and you could use that
18522,you're putting it on your head like a hat

18527,and she's got a leotard she's like I can't do it
18528,eggs boy this is turning into a big meal
18529,but he was going up up up in the dark
18530,once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
18531,I wasn't convinced she knew what it meant cause she was just kind of saying it
18532,yeah but you could use it out here too if you wanted alright forget it
18533,cheese she's telling you she's eating cheese
18534,he tried to see where he was going by looking at the stars
18535,anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flik invented a harvesting machine
18536,a meal Naima's going to eat a meal right now
18537,and we're gonna see xxx but we're gonna see some other children
18538,he tried planets and comets what he really needed to light his way was another moon
18539,such a very very good book for a very very good girl
18540,now we're gonna walk back toward the camera
18541,oh wait this is the low fat yogurt we need to get the we need to get the full fat yogurt for you
18542,I mean it was a cute they had like a little Hawaiian dance that was really cute and stuff but
18543,let me put it over here to take upstairs
18544,we're gonna go to the nursing play group
18545,taping for awhile cause this is a little precarious here
18546,when Harold looked closely what he saw wasn't a moon it was a flying saucer
18547,you can get it off the bed you can get on the bed
18548,I'm not gonna pay for her to like go hysterical every week
18549,oh would you mind um getting a bunch of those little wash+cloths
18550,aw hey don't hit me with blankie that's not so nice
18551,Harold had heard about flying saucers people saw them in the dark
18552,you wanna read the Max book with Mommy okay
18553,and then like last week I was like okay we have ballet I don't wanna go
18554,and then later in the afternoon you're gonna see
18555,and nobody knew who was inside flying them
18556,I'm gonna put this yogurt in a bowl
18557,yes if the microphone was under you it would be covered up with food and water right now
18558,he gave you a chocolate chip cookie at ten o'clock in the morning
18559,he decided he'd better land his rocket right away
18560,xxx gonna come play with you this afternoon while I work
18561,what're you doing are you having some water
18562,oh yes Mommy ran over the rake by accident today
18563,and landed it with a bump on the bottom of a strange planet
18564,and you will be able to lift heavy things run long distances
18565,xxx that's how you get things out of your throat
18566,that's what one of the dragon says on Dragon Tales
18567,turn that thing on the side honestly I haven't figured out what works myself
18568,baby Cassie's getting big I don't know if she plays with rattles anymore
18569,there was no danger falling off so big a planet
18570,then we have_to get your clothes on and go to the library
18571,however Harold thought he would feel a little bit more comfortable at the top of the planet
18572,Mommy tries to disguise your sugar intake in the morning as a pop+tart or something
18573,I was thinking maybe we'd buy her some cute clothes
18574,whoa you're really talking up a storm
18575,well I don't wanna do that because that hurts
18576,that kind of a boat is called a canoe
18577,let's read the next book in the bed here come sit with Mommy
18578,in the dark light of the stars he looked for some sign that might tell him
18579,baby Cassie just gonna start get ready to walk pretty soon
18580,no maybe later when we go to Target you can bring a little snack with you
18581,here's the wheel I'm gonna make the wheel go again
18582,yeah sometimes that is scary you have_to be a grownup to go in the ocean anyway by yourself
18583,under the bridge and over the dam looking for berries berries for jam
18584,you wanna slip on you wanna sit on Sleepy Bear's lap
18585,you're putting a lot of those in your mouth
18586,no no no I don't want you to keep hitting me
18587,oh a little tiny piece of bread that's very old thank you I'll keep that
18588,Harold had heard of men on Mars so he yelled a couple of hellos hopefully
18589,um I don't know if we're gonna have a whole bowl of this I don't know how much you're gonna like this one but we shall see hang on
18590,what is this what sound noise does the truck make when it backs up
18591,oh no they're gonna fall off the waterfall
18592,xxx played bubbles with you did she make you some big ones
18593,see that's the apple+sauce I'm gonna mix it in
18594,he thought of the flying saucer out there and thought of the things that people see in the dark
18595,where's the wheel can you bring me the wheel and I can make it go again
18596,it's like she's learned the word but she hasn't learned all the contexts in which
18597,well after we go to Target I have_to go to the bookstore to get my um
18598,the night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind
18599,okay lemme mix it a little more and then I'll give it to you
18600,what oh my glasses you can't have my glasses
18601,he was sure any man on Mars would be cordial to a visitor like Harold who had come all this way to chat with him
18602,but I won't go to school until later this afternoon
18603,Badega was eating seeds what about Genaba
18604,what was she eating was she eating seeds too or was she eating something else
18605,yep we're gonna write a thank you note to Sadiksha
18606,yeah want me to hold this for you so you can get it out
18607,you can't be that hungry if you're giving me food
18608,he had to draw on his scanty knowledge of what a man on Mars looked like
18609,because she was so thoughtful to get you such a nice nice present for your birthday
18610,well Honey we don't have that much dough so why don't you try that first
18611,but his looks wouldn't really matter in the dark so Harold didn't care much what he turned out to look like
18612,didjou wanna look at this book earlier you
18613,Naima oh ick yucky yucky spilling food on the floor
18614,is that was what Genaba was eating

18616,I think it's true Honey you're hurting me please stop
18617,do you think the camera makes a beeping sound
18618,that's why I was wondering why you were offering xxx to her
18619,oh are you trying to get it with your mouth
18620,sorry about this putting things together while on tape this is July eleventh the next morning from the last session
18621,all Harold wanted to know was there was some sort of friendly face close by
18622,let's put your backpack on so you don't lose your microphone
18623,this stuff is yucky it's all slimy and you dropped it on the floor
18624,he's not there he's not in the truck driving it

18629,well I can't read while you're I can't sit back

18632,Badega was visiting us who else was visiting us
18633,um might be able to get away with a toy on this high+chair for a few minutes
18634,let's see that was thirty seven minutes

18643,oh that truck is giving some dirt to that truck
18644,see that baby's nursing and that Mommy is hugging that baby
18645,probably the thing was about to fly to Earth and scare somebody maybe a little child
18646,I'm putting our dough in the bag to chill
18647,let's get something really fun to play with here
18648,Alan was making a noise when they came to visit us
18649,yeah that's mostly plain there's just a little bit of yogurt there
18650,don't need that if you're going in the chair
18651,Alan was using the mowing machine outside when Cecilia and Michelle came to visit us
18652,he approached on tiptoe so the thing wouldn't hear him
18653,now if you wanted them really chocolaty Honey you could do chocolate cookies with chocolate frosting would you prefer that
18654,baby elephant nurses through her mouth while her trunk hugs Mommy
18655,this is Lily's new teddy that she just got today from one of her schoolmates
18656,he doesn't have any shoes his feet are naked
18657,and he put a completely damaging crack in the flying saucer
18658,that would be nice of your friends if you crashed
18659,well Sadiksha's the little girl who gave it to you
18660,but they said it was fine so oh
18661,mm that's a good tower I like that tower thank you
18662,before the thing could grab him he was off again chuckling triumphantly
18663,and then we're gonna eat a big bowl of something delicious
18664,and I'm gonna put this one on that tower too
18665,you wanna pretend you're the hair cutter
18666,and ran as fast as he could in the dark
18667,yeah but inside the cookies do you want chocolate cookies with chocolate frosting or chocolate cookies with vanilla frosting
18668,you are somethin you know who's gonna come home now to see you
18669,happily most of the way was downhill
18670,these bubbles just are not very good they need to do a lot of resting
18671,he hoped he wouldn't fall head over heels
18672,well I'm taping her and I'm with her
18673,he arrived safely heels over head at the bottom of Mars where the rocket was
18674,yogurty yogurt that's what you're gonna have all right
18675,and he's gonna drive his car into the driveway
18676,yeah you think that says Naima it says Mets
18677,yea you know what you didn't eat very much breakfast
18678,you hafta tell me what you want and then we'll decide to make it
18679,but by this time Harold had had enough of adventure he wanted to get home in a dependable way
18680,and he's gonna shut the door of his car clunk
18681,I'm looking for other things for you to eat
18682,your shirt says Mets it does have an m which looks like an n

18690,and the points of the stars hurt Harold's feet

18693,play with the train let's go away from the camera
18694,oh in the twirl okay you want me to twirl him in the thing

18696,that is a pretty silly song isn't it

18698,instead of wishing it occurred to him at the last moment to jump aboard
18699,the bear is in the train and the boy is in the train
18700,if my mic is working you should hear me pressing these buttons
18701,stand floor Naima do you want to stand on the floor

18716,that was the mower he was cutting the grass with the mower remember

18718,then he realized the night was just about gone and it was time for the sun to come up
18719,oh the bird feeder oh you've been reading this one with xxx I bet
18720,Alan was cutting the grass with the mower
18721,so that we can see our friends at the library

18829,but Lily just nodded at Fritz and looked away
18830,actually xxx was there with his new baby brother
18831,okay now let's get a little plain yogurt in here
18832,she didn't like the thought of sharing the meadow and her friend with a stranger
18833,is that the book with pictures of people you know
18834,Lily scowled she wanted Laney to pay attention to her
18835,you bought it for your bed and it matches perfectly doesn't it
18836,do do do do do do mm yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum
18837,you wanna oh you wanna feed the parrot okay
18838,and there was some new baby there she was about your age but I don't remember her name
18839,but Laney was so busy performing for Fritz she didn't hear
18840,and howbout Tom and Pipo go for a walk we could read this book
18841,all that morning Laney played with Fritz while Lily stayed by herself at the far end of the meadow meadow
18842,nursing right now but don't you want to go to the library and see Elana
18843,no um Daisy's Mommy and Daddy are going to Florida
18844,you want me to give you carrots so you can feed him

18847,will be there she'll bring out the toys for everyone to play with
18848,come on Lily Laney bleated Fritz is picking watercress for us and it's delicious
18849,yes and it made a big noise just like that
18850,after we sing our little songs and play our games
18851,I don't know where the dolly dolly dolly book is
18852,Lily stamped one of her big back feet and glared angrily at Laney
18853,yeah I found like once they read a certain reach a certain age in like language development then we have_to regress back to baby talk
18854,you knocked down Tyler's towers didn't you
18855,look she said you can play with that frog all you want but if you're going to be friends with him you can't be friends with me
18856,oh you like to shake eggs there are some shaky things at the library actually
18857,I'll bring it over there and we can read it okay
18858,why said Laney feeling very sad and confused
18859,Naima would like some cheese can you say cheese please
18860,because said Laney that's just the way it is
18861,you want a picture of Daddy I think it's at the beginning there
18862,the next morning Lily didn't go to the wildflower meadow but went to have breakfast on the other side of the grassy hill
18863,shall we make a tower and have you knock it down
18864,that says nope a nope mm yogurty yogurt
18865,did Daddy try and swipe your squishy pillow to sleep with last night
18866,oh whoops all the rocks fell right out
18867,Michael was sitting on his mother's lap
18868,that's another made up phrase isn't it
18869,yeah there was a hair there in your mouth
18870,and did you say Daddy you can't have my squishy pillow
18871,well here's a surprise I thought you'd be with Laney
18872,you have anything else you need to look at when we go to the mall
18873,let's see did you say you wanted wheat
18874,Mommy's been spilling the yogurt here I see
18875,I think maybe that plant over there needs some more water
18876,we were but now she wants to play with some frog
18877,he yeah I know because he was sleeping on your squishy pillow
18878,and then after we go to the library and you have a nap
18879,that was a lot of raisin for you wasn't it
18880,okay one sec let me get our frosting into the bowl
18881,back and forth they rocked there's the rocking chair
18882,somebody was at the door it was actually xxx in the end
18883,well maybe I can help said Penelope I know a lot about friends and friendship
18884,and it made that kind of a big crashing noise
18885,yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy
18886,you need a smaller ring to fit in there
18887,he kept handing you different things what you want my pillow what you want something else huh huh can't hear you
18888,let's go over here where the plant is and I'll give you some water in the watering can
18889,you wanna taste it and see if you like it
18890,I'm gonna put some water in your watering can for you
18891,ah if I'm not mistaken you're upset because Laney wants to play with Fritz but it's perfectly fine to have more than
18892,we're gonna see xxx and her Mom named xxx
18893,soon Michael and dolly were on mother's lap
18894,is there a dress anywhere in this room on the couch is there a dress on the couch

18897,and who did we see yesterday we saw a lot of people yesterday
18898,boat needs me said Michael I'll bring boat
18899,it's perfectly fine to have more than one good friend at a time
18900,yeah maybe when the squishy pillow turns four it'll be as big as you
18901,friendship is the perfect thing to share and having more friends mean having more fun
18902,Michael climbed back on mother's lap with boat on one side
18903,clean up a bug I probably have cleaned up a bug
18904,a little bit wet Mommy's gonna give the plant this water okay
18905,what's it say can you read it to me
18906,I'm silly cause I'm putting it on my head
18907,the chicky's really too big
18908,we met another little boy whose name I don't remember
18909,Penelope thinks she's so smart Lily thought but she doesn't understand
18910,you want me to build another tower and you can knock it down
18911,Lily started to eat but the plants were not as sweet as the ones by the pond
18912,today was a hot day wasn't it
18913,yeah it doesn't eat or drink or do anything or breathe you're right
18914,yeah xxx xxx brought things for us she bought some things for us
18915,and she heard the laughter and shouting of two voices
18916,we sang songs and we played on the drum
18917,I did clean up a bug this morning but I didn't think you noticed
18918,she saw Laney and Fritz picking flowers together
18919,I really couldn't have said it better myself
18920,these pizzas are available in medium or large
18921,and they had we had scarves to play with
18922,I see some leaves and some rocks that need to be raked
18923,they've got some nerve she said making all that racket
18924,choose a crust from our thin crust selections white wheat multigrain low carb and veggie
18925,oh we never saw the puppy inside that house at that party that day
18926,whatever they're doing they're certainly having fun they don't need my help and that's fine with me
18927,we were talking about how there was a puppy inside but we never saw that puppy
18928,the rug smells dirty that's probably because we're walking all over it
18929,these pizzas are low in fat high in protein and full of flavor
18930,that afternoon Lily was sulking in the shade of a tree and Fritz hurried up and called Lily come quick Laney wants you right away
18931,do you think the koala would like the to wear the ribbon on his ear let me tie the ribbon on his ear
18932,that's the sound of the cereal going on the cereal
18933,and when we finished shopping we visited xxx and xxx
18934,oh let's see what are you giving me
18935,what does she want Lily asked coldly but Fritz had already hurried back over the hill

18947,it's not a cat it looks like a cat cause it's so little but it's a puppy it's a baby dog
18948,I was thinking for your birthday party that maybe you would like to have everyone make their own pizzas
18949,do you remember who we saw yesterday when we went visiting
18950,I know you don't but you know once it's on you can forget about it
18951,carefully Michael tucked his blanket around boat and dolly

23252,we should call them on the phone and say would you like to play with us sometime soon
23253,I think she is trying to tickle Glenmae she's sticking her nose up in the back of her shirt
23254,and then he was leaving the house and what happened

23272,page seventy two in this cookbook is completely missing

24180,oh there's Mr and Mrs Mallard they're looking for a place to live
24181,that's right Naima you know this story don't you
24182,I think maybe they're gonna have some chicks
24183,well what I was gonna say is this place might actually be open on Sundays since it's different ownership
24184,so they need to have a nice nest to live in
24185,oh you're right she's letting them slip off the string and fall onto the floor and so he's tripping on em
24186,means she wants to come out and be by herself
24187,and then she keeps eating the little bowl of porridge
24188,so they're trying to figure out where's a good place to build our nest
24189,and we have the shaky eggs we could use those to pretend that they are the eggs that you're lay in
24190,what does that mean we can ride him in the sling
24191,I'm gonna grate the salty cheese
24192,oh she wants to come out all by herself oh
24193,a bed that doesn't look like a bed that looks like a toucan
24194,well you wouldn't wanna build a nest in a bad place
24195,oh xxx I don't think xxx nursie's with his Mommy
24196,you wouldn't wanna build a nest in someone's bath room

24206,I guess I'd better help that baby get get the high+chair off
24207,would the pillows make a nice soft nest to lay your eggs in
24208,she puts some soap on it and she uses a sponge
24209,you want me to put the sling on you so that you can carry him
24210,I think they want you to turn the page and tell them what's on the next page
24211,and she washes off the bowl until it's all clean
24212,well what else would be a bad place to build a nest
24213,and the chicks are babies so they need a nice soft place to lie in
24214,you haven't seen that for a long time that wagon
24215,when you eat salty cheese like that all by itself especially if you're really hungry that can happen
24216,oh you're putting that book back in the book rack
24217,let me put this bear clip back in your hair that fell out
24218,let's ask let see if bird children know the answer to that question

24246,let's go to the bedroom to read them shall we
24247,new and clean and they're in these nice colors
24248,and I I don't exactly remember the route but
24249,cause there's snow coming out of the sky out of the clouds
24250,hm where do you think the toddler could be hiding
24251,that pig is making a paper hat that's a triangle shaped hat
24252,I'm putting the sling on you so you can carry Sleepy Bear
24253,mm weather watchers had been predicting a big snow+storm for days
24254,oh are you gonna read them another book
24255,or do you want me to wash off the little blue spoon
24256,uh I'm gonna talk to xxx just for a minute to xxx and then I will
24257,that end of the clothes+pin looks like an animals mouth like a crocodile
24258,she goes upstairs and she climbs into the biggest bed that she sees
24259,did I I wanna see your position what's the side stretch position can you show me
24260,puppy wants to hide once more so cat counts up to ten
24261,oh if you open your eyes that's what you gonna do
24262,oh do you think they'd like Mcduff comes home
24263,he's going for a very nice ride I think
24264,now I can actually see a wire from here but don't see the morning dove sitting on it
24265,I think we should think about maybe making some notes for people we could make Easter cards for people today
24266,and she says uh wait a minute this bed is too hard
24267,as bunny looks behind a bush puppy jumps up
24268,I don't wanna have it because you've been squeezing it
24269,the ice+cream cone is cone shaped the cone part is cone shape
24270,she can't get comfy it's not a comfy bed for her
24271,yeah you were ready to be home from Martha's Vineyard
24272,I will have one that you haven't been squeezing
24273,do you remember we saw the picture the ah not a picture we saw a real mourning dove nest at the museum of natural history
24274,let's play tag says puppy as he runs behind a tree
24275,what did you say it was doing
24276,well we could glue things and we could also use stickers
24277,okay I think this is a good way for Sleepy Bear to travel
24278,do you wanna give me a piece that you haven't been
24279,and then she climbs out of that bed and goes into the medium sized bed
24280,I wouldn't wanna build to build a nest near a camera
24281,do you wanna try hanging up the dolls clothes with the clothes+pins
24282,puppy jumps up in the flowers and says
24283,we could send them to hm who could we send them to
24284,he's cozy you're carrying him in the sling
24285,um I was calling because um we're actually gonna leave town for the weekend a little bit early tomorrow so
24286,it was was that a messy nest
24287,I think he's a dog who likes to be comfy
24288,oh dear say cat and bunny rain is starting to fall
24289,what we could use a clothes make a little clothes+line in the house
24290,she says this bed is too soft it's like sleeping on a big fluffy pillow
24291,in the sling like I used to take you when you were a baby
24292,she wants to put shoes on her bare feet
24293,oh I wouldn't wanna build a nest right next to a bear
24294,mm so that the cars can drive you're right
24295,that's fine with me says puppy splashing is the best game of all
24296,I'm not exactly sure of the time but uh probably like three
24297,we'll go into the bedroom and we'll do some reading
24298,and then she gets out of the medium sized bed and she goes over to the littlest bed of all
24299,yeah you know what Naima where are your sandals I've been wondering
24300,I think I already asked you to stop stepping on my leg
24301,I wouldn't wanna build a nest on an airplane
24302,y'wanna tell the bears what's happening in the picture
24303,I'm taping over some tape where the audio was not recorded properly and today is April twenty fourth
24304,so the plow is taking the snow out of the streets
24305,I I know that you do like them a lot let's go to the bedroom
24306,xxx is the one who gave you give yourself to the rain that book
24307,d'you know how to make the puppy go up and down
24308,she's in the littlest bed and she says mm oh this is so comfy
24309,even before the snow stopped falling town work crews were out with their trucks to begin a long hard job of digging out
24310,what could we make here that would be easy
24311,give yourself to the rain that has a lot of poems in it right
24312,I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a cat
24313,were you saying you were gonna
24314,yeah fog horns do tell ships to stay away Daddy was telling you about all about that wasn't he
24315,would you like to get it out of the diaper and flush it down the toilet
24316,and there's a picture of a flicker in that book flicker bird
24317,why do you cover your eyes when you hear the sound of the morning doves
24318,what are you gonna put in that nice wooden box
24319,the medium sized bed is the one that's too soft
24320,should we tell the stories in your bed over here
24321,I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a dog yikes yikes yikes
24322,look at all the houses and buildings and schools and there's a church
24323,I probably won't be there much earlier
24324,if you're happy and you know it wiggle your nose
24325,well what else are we gonna do with it
24326,one at a time one at a time it's easier
24327,yup I think we have them here at our house we could see a flicker
24328,the little bed is the one that is very very comfy
24329,if you're happy and you know it wiggle your nose
24330,I think that's what we're gonna do
24331,you could doinkaboink it with Oatios or wheat if you want to
24332,that's right dogs barking is loud and the birds might get annoyed by the dogs barking
24333,in fact I think remember that time that the bird was making a really really loud noise on the roof
24334,all the buildings and look I think that's a snowplow over there
24335,that would be good I just wanted to let
24336,do you want to pretend to be a mourning dove on a nest
24337,cause your cause your legs are hot I guess
24338,if you're happy and you know it and you really wanna show it if you're happy and you know it wiggle your nose
24339,well I'll go change you in the in the changing table then
24340,that would be an a noisy annoying noise for the birds wouldn't it
24341,okay I'm just trying to think whether we have anything like a clothes+line in the house
24342,it sounded like this kinda like duh remember that
24343,they walk in the door they want to rock in their chairs
24344,they go into the living room and papa bear sits in his chair and he starts to rock
24345,I think that was a flicker actually
24346,oh I know we have that twine that I was using for the garden
24347,you know you didn't really have very much breakfast here I'm xxx I'm noticing
24348,and he rocks a couple of times and then he stops
24349,where can we tie it here in the living room
24350,you can use the juice to help you swallow that egg
24351,or maybe those are telephone wires actually
24352,we could probably find something that would fit in there
24353,if you're happy and you know it and you really wanna show it if you're happy and you know it touch your eyebrow
24354,and he says somebody's been rocking in my chair
24355,may be it'll be okay to build a nest near a duck
24356,I'm gonna take all the food away if you keep doing that
24357,ooh what was it that was moving
24358,you're gonna have_to snack a little later I think
24359,like you could put your puzzle pieces in there
24360,you don't have_to wear it I'm gonna put it right there okay
24361,well I think the ball is a little bit too big
24362,I need ya to lie down here so we could get that poop out of that diaper
24363,if you're happy and you know it shout out loud
24364,and I'm gonna have a nice pillow to lean up against there for myself
24365,you wanna to sit on a potty and poop
24366,hey that's the same did you hear the noise out there
24367,I think Goldilocks has been rocking in the Poppa_Bear's chair
24368,if you're happy and you know it shout out loud
24369,is the same noise that Carmen makes that must of been a cardinal
24370,I have a feeling you don't like these strawberries
24371,wanna try again or you want me to try it for you
24372,the wire that you saw at Craigville beach with Daddy and the ducks that you saw on the way
24373,and then what are we gonna read tonight for a story

24375,if you're happy and you know it and you really wanna show it if you're happy and you know it shout out loud
24376,oh okay I was gonna wash off the bottle cause it had a lot of food on the outside of it
24377,and the mama bear goes and sits in her chair
24378,she starts to rock and what does she say
24379,it looks like it has a kiwi seed on it
24380,splish splash I was taking a bath every little sun must shine
24381,it is the morning of August twenty ninth two thousand and three
24382,you gonna kick the cat litter over the poop to hide it

24384,you do like to step on your pony why do you like to step on your pony
24385,she says somebody's been rocking in my chair too
24386,his collar is what has something on it that says
24387,shine I heard that song you were mixing up two songs I think
24388,did Daddy say it was he thought it was for a phone that they used to have in the lifeguard's chair
24389,ah I'm not sure it sounded almost like thunder except I don't think it is a thunder
24390,remember you glued the pasta and the shapes made out of cloth and paper in that
24391,yes Goldilocks is still sleeping upstairs at this point
24392,someone's waiting to have a tooth checked
24393,I think that's what you told me that he said it was
24394,well it doesn't look like it has a cut
24395,the Edward book is in Mommy and Daddy's room I think
24396,I would actually like to get more of these bowls
24397,that was at the group that you did that play group
24398,I think we're going to need to go into your room to get some wipes because I can't get all the poop off with just the plain toilet+paper
24399,well it was to small of a noise it really wasn't a very big noise
24400,remember we saw a lifeguard today at Douse's beach
24401,the Bunny Rabbit song is over the nursies
24402,and the spoons that go with em are just right too
24403,there's a bird over at the feeder Naima

24407,it might be a cut that's hard for me to see
24408,oh you wanna put that on your coat rack
24409,I'm just trying to think where we're gonna put the twine
24410,d'jamme to go with you while you do that
24411,if it's hurting now from the kiwi that probably means it will hurt if you get tomato sauce on it
24412,and here are the children riding bicycles the birds better watch out
24413,oh you know we could do it over there at the fire+place if we clean the toys away a little bit
24414,oh you're gonna put that loop on the hook
24415,yes they do they like to go in the water with swimsuits
24416,all I said was to watch your feet sometimes when you move that book rack
24417,those ducks better watch out so the bicycles don't run them over
24418,hey you ate a lot of that egg good job
24419,you have got the loop on your thumb don't you

24506,they've been out walking so they're hungry too just like Goldilocks was
24507,that's a game it's kind of a game that kids play
24508,because the bicycle the person on the bicycle didn't realize that there were ducks in the way
24509,all of this was on Wednesday July whatever it is twenty nine or thirtieth
24510,Mommy is the one who wears nursing shirts
24511,are you singing that song that american folk music song again
24512,um so the papa bear looked at his bowl he didn't even have_to take a bite
24513,oh let's clean them up in a nice neat way though okay
24514,you gonna make a row for them just like we made rows in the garden
24515,here're the ducks they're growing up and getting bigger now they're kinda like toddler ducks
24516,cause it's fun to make the snowballs and then they throw them at each other and they go phwack
24517,okay you can go on this for a few minutes
24518,I don't want just everything dumped in the living room ouch
24519,ducks in the mill pond geese in the clover
24520,he just looked at his bowl and said somebody's been eating my porridge
24521,I would spare space if you wanted to have them in the vegetable garden
24522,I had a very amazing conversation this morning about what the world is
24523,well I'll get the pink and orange nursing shirt for you okay
24524,and then you can get in your high+chair and have some lunch
24525,hm I don't know if it's a bear it looks like it might be a
24526,that's how they get around they swim and that's how they look for food in the water
24527,oh the dinosaur the dinosaur's tail sounds like thwack you remember that
24528,yes I think Goldilocks was the one eating his porridge
24529,you can do the same thing that we were talking bout this morning
24530,I do like a nice neat room oh I see what you're doing
24531,Jimmy crack corn n' I don't care Jimmy crack corn n' I don't care
24532,we actually we talked about it the other day and then Naima brought it up this morning
24533,I hope your elbow hasn't been in the way over here
24534,well you know to be more stable you should go on the kitchen floor
24535,you know what we never combed your hair after your bath
24536,she's teaching them to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels
24537,it's the same kind that you used to like all the time
24538,and we should put hair elastics in shouldn't we
24539,that's kind of like when I tell you have be careful in the parking lot
24540,yeah that's part of American folk music isn't it
24541,this area right here actually gets morning sun
24542,if I were making it stable I would move it to the kitchen floor 'cause that's more flat
24543,now the other thing we need to do is to find the uhhh
24544,here it is and there's also brown rice how lucky
24545,I'm gonna test the pasta and see if it's ready
24546,and that cars are dangerous she's she's teaching them the same thing she's saying cars and bicycles and other things on wheels are dangerous cause they can bump into you
24547,and the baby bear looks at his bowl which is completely clean remember because she washed it out this time
24548,you're reading the book to the bears at Toddler Time I thought
24549,the kid in the red jacket is making a snow+man
24550,this whole big place I was saying that all the towns that we know about are all in the world
24551,but you could just clear out some of whatever's there and put them
24552,and he says somebody's been eating my porridge
24553,you've got some rocks in that lego box I noticed
24554,do you want it to be warm or you want it cold
24555,she washed out the bowl and it's completely empty
24556,maybe Tuesday when it's if maybe if it's not raining
24557,I think maybe the baby bear starts to cry at this point
24558,we're gonna cook something with spices today
24559,I think that's she's carrying some snow to build a wall there
24560,what other kinds of animals have are mammals
24561,you can chew some but it's not quite ready yet
24562,well we're straightening up so that you have room
24563,and the papa bear says don't worry we'll make you some more porridge
24564,oh I thought you were done with the cheese
24565,and the theme was that you were talking about nursing a lot
24566,that does look like it could be a baby lizard
24567,I'm going to measure out these black eyed beans
24568,it's just a fun thing to do that's all
24569,I was pressing what kind of a button
24570,early spring one to two weeks before last frost so really they should be
24571,then when they were done eating they went upstairs to take a nap
24572,and I bet this would also stabilize it if we put this right here
24573,do you know what we we have that we can use at nap time now
24574,and I see a lot of kids who are sliding on sleds down the hill
24575,can you just why don't you practice by just putting a clothes+pin on that line
24576,yeah all of those places are in the world
24577,I was pressing a button on the timer
24578,come put it on the kitchen floor and that will make it stable
24579,it looked like it was made out of Play_Doh
24580,okay so I'll give you to pour as soon as you finish eating you can do that
24581,what color are the other rocks that you have there
24582,you're doing a good job not spilling very much
24583,that sled is being pulled by a mommy
24584,yeah and do you know what I brought in from the car for you to listen to in the tape player
24585,you're getting really good at feeding yourself
24586,do it the same way you do it on the box you have_to hold the top of the clothes+pin
24587,I can adjust it a little bit so that it won't bother you quite so much
24588,I'm gonna cook these black eyed beans with spices
24589,two to three foot tall that's really tall for bachelor's buttons
24590,would you like to get into bed and start nap time
24591,it's so nice when someone gives you a present
24592,oh they're going to see Tahoe on the way home
24593,let's have the mac and cheese and you can have carrots from a jar too if you want
24594,sometimes people give presents on birthdays or holidays but sometimes people give each other presents just 'cause they want to
24595,I think you're remembering when it was winter and Mommy pulled you and the sled up the driveway and you saw Tahoe
24596,d'you wanna get down or do you wanna do something in the
24597,I've never seen bachelor's buttons that tall
24598,they go upstairs and the papa bear says somebody's been sleeping in my bed
24599,he's having sausages on top of his pudding
24600,d'you wanna pour some beans or count beans
24601,you gonna listen to the tape while you're nursing
24602,that'll be nice I think that would be a good place
24603,well I'm actually gonna wash those beans now
24604,find the doll clothes you need to find them before you hang them up
24605,whoa that's too much for you isn't it
24606,oh what is the hare doing with the man
24607,but I'll I'll save some for you to pour
24608,I'm trying to cool down the pasta by putting it in the cold spaghetti sauce
24609,you mean you wanna hear what we did yesterday
24610,I'm now testing whether the buzz is coming from or rather which trans
24611,d'you mean you want me to take the tray off
24612,it looks like the hare is listening to the man saying something
24613,they'll probably make another noise in just a minute
24614,there when you're done you can practice pouring with those
24615,the bears are all cozy on the examination table I see that
24616,well the toaster's unplugged that's okay
24617,but if yer gonna pour beans yer gonna do it here is what I'm trying to tell you
24618,and in the morning we went out and did errands
24619,I think we don't have enough maple syrup to really make xxx
24620,well your hand's messy and you're making the table
24621,okay this is what we're gonna do
24622,it's a glass measuring cup isn't it
24623,xxx in the Max book that we saw at the library
24624,it's still august twelfth I replaced a battery and hopefully the buzz will not reoccur
24625,I have one and a half cups of black eyed beans here
24626,just like you did it on the box the same way but you have_to point it down
24627,I think he says zoom when he comes down the chimney
24628,we bought a rake at the hardware store just for you
24629,are you sleepy are you too sleepy to eat lunch
24630,hares do nurse hares are just like rabbits they do nurse they're mammals
24631,oh did he did an ambulance taking him there
24632,would you like to go for a ride in the car
24633,I haven't been using it so I haven't noticed
24634,well because then if they spill they fall right on the high+chair tray and then it's easy to pick them up
24635,I'm sorry Naima I wasn't paying attention to you
24636,and this is gonna move but that's okay
24637,oh you were the driver of the ambulance
24638,I'm looking for bread so that I can make the toast for you
24639,and we might need to nurse again if it thunders
24640,we stopped to make sure that your shoes were still the right size
24641,oh so you helped him get into the ambulance you know ambulances actually have bed inside them did you know that
24642,black eyed beans are white and they have little black dots in them
24643,the previous taping was from this morning so there's been a bit of a gap here
24644,that was very quick we didn't stay there for very long
24645,and you can take we'll take off your bib too
24646,are you finished eating can I get you more food or are you done
24647,I'm not a big fan of bread in the freezer
24648,would you like some juice instead of water to drink
24649,aw I'll give you a big hug and that will make it better okay I'm turning this off
24650,you need to use words to say what you want
24651,you want it over here or on top of your pasta
24652,it looks like there's some sun on your feet
24653,Naima please don't wipe your hands on the table like that
24654,we can't put it up right because the twine is too small
24655,oh I wasn't talking about the fan
24656,well whenever you're done I'll clean you up and you can either pour practice pouring the beans or you could wash one of your friends
24657,I don't want you to do that are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk
24658,I think Mommy's gonna sit and eat with you too
24659,if it were thicker twine then it would stay up right I think
24660,well you can sit there but I'm not gonna give you lunch until you sit in your high+chair
24661,now it's in the sun can you feel the sun
24662,how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily
24663,you want me to put it on the the the c_d player
24664,and would you like to have some salmon or some crab
24665,is that a good spoon for what you're eating
24666,do you wanna get some more doll clothes and hang them up to dry
24667,I think we're gonna go to town hall before we go to toddler time
24668,oh well today is June first and all the other taping was done on May thirty first
24669,now I think that snake is reading these words
24670,why don't you look in your room and see if there's some in there
24671,gonna turn off the tape recorder and uh you wanna go see if you really wanna see Daddy
24672,I'm gonna eat pasta with salty cheese
24673,that's a mattress it use to be in your baby bunk
24674,what is Nai are you looking for the c_d
24675,you know Daddy's gonna come upstairs as soon as he's done making his phone calls
24676,why don't we do the sticker book together
24677,think I'm gonna heat up my tomato sauce
24678,that's a mattress we used for the baby bunk
24679,that means they really like something a lot
24680,you don't wanna do the sticker book
24681,you could put it right on top of that one actually
24682,this is tricky you gotta hold that with one hand
24683,I just thought of a new game we could play but let's play what's under first
24684,because a baby bunk is like a little bed for babies
24685,oh the bear's gonna go to the South Harmouth library
24686,so that probably means she's in that bag that xxx made for you the toy bag
24687,some of them are upside down so I have_to fix them
24688,they can't really go next to each other
24689,wanna take it out and we'll find the page where it goes
24690,he was rolling on the beach in the
24691,you think where he lives there's a South Harmouth library
24692,because the baby bunk was attached to Mommy and Daddy's bed
24693,then he was shaking the water off yeah
24694,and here's some juice if you wanna drink it
24695,and you were too little to be in the bed so we had to attach your bed to our bed it was a little tiny bed
24696,and I bet his Mommy says you can't go to the library unless you put your socks and shoes on
24697,you wanna play what's under with the parent cards
24698,what a nice doggie you were patting him
24699,I took them out 'cause usually we don't play with the parent cards
24700,can you stand up so I can put this diaper on
24701,those morning doves are very nice birds Naima
24702,I'm gonna make spicy beans
24703,I think the bears Mommy would be a bear don't you think
24704,I can mix it up that might be good I'll put it here
24705,maybe we'll turn this back on when we're actually talking instead of eating
24706,you know you can hang the clothes up right on the box where you've been putting the clothes+pins
24707,Mommy and Naima can make spicy beans that's right
24708,then I'll put the yogurt next to it and then I'll mix them together
24709,now the baby's ready to come out and say hi to its mommy and nurse
24710,there've only been about five or ten minutes that've elapsed
24711,those are sort of those are like dolls
24712,that place we visited it was the vacation house that xxx and xxx were staying at
24713,I am talking to the camera actually
24714,in case you need to pee or poop suddenly
24715,why do why does why do babies do that
24716,I'm trying to clean up cook beans clean you up

24720,it was like a city except it was really a town
24721,you can pick them all up and put them back in that pitcher
24722,are you just about ready to get cleaned up
24723,do you wanna put it where it goes
24724,yeah it's not good to really do gardening when the ground is wet because you spread things all over the place
24725,alright what did I do with this okay sorry that mic
24726,I'm not even sure that chair could be cleaned
24727,was not in a good place now it is I hope
24728,I could show you and then you could try it after I do it
24729,when xxx when xxx baby comes we mail that present to the baby or we'll bring it to him
24730,uh you know what there is there's some delicious black beans that xxx made
24731,put one in the pitcher and every time you out one in say a number
24732,we do need to tug up more weeds well maybe who knows maybe today it won't rain very much and maybe it will get a little dryer and maybe we can do things outside
24733,are you upset because I didn't understand you
24734,I think their seeds are all gone in the big feeder
24735,what noise does Sheep make when he falls out of bed

24737,I'm gonna wash your hands a little bit
24738,you were digging in the dirt today weren't you
24739,but when you make up words that's what happens
24740,remember what was I reading xxx oh remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in
24741,and I think you might possibly have dirt on your hands
24742,glappens now I know what you're saying there
24743,oh those were the baby words he used
24744,well baby toys are just like a little things they can pull on or push on or look at
24745,well anyway I didn't finish telling you all the other kinds of seeds we're gonna plant
24746,yeah we call it a bear chair where we eat the tomatoes
24747,if we're gonna go to town hall we may be too late already
24748,oh you're making a machine for the beans
24749,you wanna want me to look for Emily Mommily so you can wash her
24750,directions explain how to use something or how to fix something

24753,you haven't had a banana for two weeks
24754,we need to get some poles to put the beans on
24755,well I hope we're gonna go to both

24769,oh you need me to take it out I think it was in the beans
24770,I'll getcher small wooden spoon that I think is in here
24771,I used to help you when you were littler but you can climb up

24816,well it for a minute it looked like a little dragonfly but it wasn't it was just a piece of fuzz
24817,we went to gym class that's what we do on Thursdays
24818,well I think if you're gonna wash Emily Mommily you need to leave your bib on because it will catch some of the water than spills
24819,I have all these dirty dishes in here that are in my way and they're making some noise
24820,what xxx what kinds of spices are you putting in it
24821,I don't want you to spit out that food okay
24822,I thought you saw the grapes the other day yesterday
24823,I'm trying to think of what this may have come off of
24824,why don't you xxx pick out something from the fridge that you want
24825,there are probably many different kinds of fog
24826,she is holding on to the horses harness that's what that is
24827,does she tell him to put it on his head
24828,do you think he knows how to turn it on
24829,I dunno if it had a turtle did it
24830,here she is she's ready to have her bath
24831,the chicken's looking at the words cluck cluck
24832,oh what animal's gonna eat that delicious bean soup of yours
24833,yeah if you feel this fuzz and then feel the black part of the raccoon's tail
24834,I think there were three two or three wiggly things
24835,iron I I begins I stands for iron letter I
24836,wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
24837,is that what she eats when she's finished having a bath
24838,wiggly wiggly wiggly you were going back and forth from one to the other
24839,iron is a tool that we use to make clothes look nice
24840,are you thinking about when we were at the center for breast feeding
24841,wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
24842,I think it could must go near the letter I don't you think
24843,well you know there's a certain appeal to even though it's foggy at the moment
24844,I think you were right I think it's an ostrich
24845,it's a little bit like an oval and a little bit like a semicircle
24846,you need to look at the shape and figure out which way does it match
24847,what does it mean the horse wants to horse the people
24848,it's kinda hard to tell because ostriches and emus are similar in some ways
24849,electricity is what makes the lights go on
24850,it's a big one she can have fun splashing in this bathtub
24851,no you know what we don't drink water with our fingers
24852,there were other children there there were swings
24853,it looked to me yesterday like we had a fair bit
24854,cause that doesn't there isn't such a word as horse somebody
24855,because it's a pattern the animals are pattern on the sheet
24856,I'll give you water in a sippy cup if you wanna taste water I don't want you sticking your fingers
24857,does she need a little washcloth so you can scrub her
24858,I don't know about that xxx you'd think that but I don't know why
24859,oh well Naima could have just pancakes with the blueberries in them and eat them like muffins
24860,a reason it makes all that noise is because it's using electricity
24861,what kinda toys are you gonna sell here
24862,boring usually means the opposite of that
24863,when you woken up a little bit more you can help me to take things from back yard to the garage
24864,am I gonna be the customer or is one of your animals
24865,boring usually means it's not interesting
24866,on Tuesday I fell sleep in my front carrier
24867,it's sort of egg shaped isn't it
24868,Naima eat please don't please don't play with that
24869,are you sure you don't want some baby yogurt with grape
24870,ya gonna put the jelly where it goes
24871,cause drinking properly means you drink with your mouth not with your fingers
24872,well you need to sit properly if your gonna stay here
24873,xxx said it takes a long time because it stops everywhere
24874,it's a funny word isn't it
24875,those things have been those things have both been here a long time it's not becoming
24876,you know I don't know if these are lambs or goats
24877,oh you think you called her xxx when you were a baby
24878,the man didn't get stung because he was avoiding the yellow jackets
24879,what kinds of spices are you gonna put in it
24880,well pants begins with the letter p but jeans begins with the letter j
24881,I thought this could be another game we could play
24882,you want me to give you a sippy cup with water in it
24883,you were really mixing up her name a lot when she was visiting
24884,there's other books that you got from the library and you have a new book from the bookstore
24885,with your fingers do you wanna use the knife
24886,I think these are goat Naima I even think this might be a goat
24887,that means that he would get very very sick if he were stung
24888,dya want regular butter on you toast cow cow butter
24889,oh well the thing is I was about to make myself some tea and that means I'm gonna be back and forth to the kitchen for a few minutes

24891,you told me that you were gonna tell Daddy that you got this book xxx
24892,you hit the ball and the panda bear throws it to Sleepy Bear
24893,why don't we buy some more things at this store
24894,the people are feeling and petting the goats here
24895,and then we'll go to the other store we'll be doing a lot of shopping today
24896,Mommy's gonna run in the other room to get another cookbook to look at
24897,and looks like he put it in the middle of the table too
24898,you know what I'm gonna put your hair up in a bun because
24899,you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it
24900,boring just means something is not interesting
24901,I think a little food would be a good idea
24902,let me get this cord out of your way here
24903,you know you could pretend to buy the barn that we just bought at the Waldorf school store
24904,we looked up on the computer to see which library had it 'cause she really wanted it
24905,Naima would you like to eat some applesauce or some carrots
24906,is it really shorter to go on the ferries
24907,because your hair is getting food in it and not that
24908,that means they like the people they don't
24909,before we go swimming before we go to the beach today
24910,we could buy it from miss Mahoney who we bought it from
24911,if your hair gets food in it it will get snarls
24912,I'm gonna go put some water on for my tea okay
24913,you should probably sit on the potty and try to poop
24914,I wasn't I wasn't sure if they were or not

24933,the goat is just drinking its milk from the bottle
24934,things that I'm going to put in the basement
24935,does she use diapers or a potty when she goes pee+pee and poop
24936,'cause if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people
24937,we started to read this in the library and it was so interesting I decided to bring it home
24938,let's clean let's put all the beans back
24939,oh you're still sleeping okay I'll be careful not wake the baby up
24940,right why don't you pick something out of the refrigerator
24941,let's go ask him if he wants to come upstairs
24942,actually let's put them all in the small metal container
24943,alright do you want baby yogurt because it's way in the back somewhere
24944,the reason you can tell it's a rooster is it has all this red on its head
24945,is it possible to know which clothes you're gonna wear tomorrow
24946,would you like to carry a friend around in it
24947,it's kinda like I Spy but it's also counting
24948,well the thing is if we drove there and then took the ferry back by then it might not
24949,would you like to take someone for a ride in it
24950,ha you're getting cozy in a funny position ha
24951,when I woke up I saw a handful of hay
24952,right you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn
24953,and we just had a little battle about the tape
24954,well we're gonna put 'em back 'cause we're gonna you said you wanted to get out you said I'm done and we need to get ready to go to beach right

24963,somebody's getting some milk out of the goat's udder
24964,I'm going to read the book but I'm also going to put this transmitter in your pocket
24965,and that was in a different town called Provincetown
24966,oh you're gonna carry it around in the pail
24967,maybe you could take him on a hike like the way Mommy and Daddy took
24968,it was like a city except it was really a town Provincetown
24969,um you're gonna clean those up off the floor too Naima
24970,boy I remember that time I was sick and I was eating like massive quantities of tea n' buttered toast and nothing else
24971,oh yeah there's a bunch of oh and there's a giraffe even
24972,that's what happens when you leave something xxx in the
24973,that's where they were having their vacation in Provincetown
24974,take it off and uh just turn it to the off position
24975,they take it out using their hands and then they drink it
24976,we need to buy more smoothie remember we went to the store yesterday and they didn't have the right kind of smoothie
24977,and Mommy is gonna wear one too and we look at the book
24978,and if you want to go to the beach you will have_to pick those up first
24979,it's sort of tall it's taller than the horses
24980,I didn't hear any but maybe there were some
24981,do you want me to get off so you can see more animals
24982,I think there are seeds are all gone in the big feeder in this little feeder right here there's some seeds I can see them
24983,just look at Mommy face Mommy I'm gonna put it on your back
24984,before you go to the beach you need to clean those up
24985,she doesn't want to carry around this tape thing
24986,well if I made something here it would be
24987,that store doesn't carry that kind of smoothie I was very disappointed
24988,do you want me to tell you who's gonna be there
24989,it's gonna be very crunchy and right now it's actually also hot
24990,they're not saying that but they're implying it 'cause they're talking about new projects for upgrading border crossings
24991,this is the way you were in the backpack when you went to Kawadee Head
24992,I have some dal cooking on the stove I kinda need to stir it do you wanna come with me
24993,the advantage is I could make it sort of pseudo healthy
24994,yeah there is a picture of a cow right there
24995,I'm gonna cut some so that you can have some
24996,if we're gonna go to town hall we may be too late already
24997,oh I see you're a bird who doesn't nurse
24998,yeah there's a picture of a zebra's bottom there
24999,oh the way it is on Mommy and Daddy sometimes
25000,I'm gonna cool it down before I give it to you don't worry
25001,I wonder if he's gonna put it in his soup
25002,There is Tigger oh there he is Tigger is right there
25003,well I think it just has to boil for a while longer
25004,Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that
25005,yeah well I hope we're gonna go to both I just forgot that there's something happening at town hall today
25006,but ah when it's time to put the spices in you could help me
25007,he needs to be more upright so he can see everything
25008,I don't think that was I think that maybe was just something that was on the floor
25009,well I don't think you sang the cranberry one
25010,no I haven't put any spices in just yet
25011,oh that's perfect I think he's looking forward to hiking
25012,there's a lot more beans here and under the high+chair too
25013,mm I'm gonna put cream+cheese on my bagel
25014,but I will put some spices in when it's ready
25015,oh the bird wants to get a feeder and put seeds in it oh
25016,looks like they are looking at a piece of paper
25017,I think Griz is in the kitchen sitting in a chair let's go in 'cause I wanna start my water anyway
25018,you wanna put some shorts on because we gonna go outside and take that stuff to the garage
25019,so you're hiking at Kawadee Head do you like it here
25020,I don't know if you've ever had black raspberries
25021,oh may be we should think about getting some real supper for Naima
25022,why don't you stay on the floor because we'll put this on
25023,I'll give you naked bagel I have some here for you that's naked you don't have_to eat the cream+cheese
25024,what are the kinds of things you can see at Kawadee Head
25025,well we could have a whole hour on it I spose
25026,I don't think you've ever had huckleberries either
25027,okay I'm just going let me just see how long this is this is quite long to be reading
25028,well because once it gets cold it'll be too cold to keep going outside and slapping things around and organizing things so be better if we could get it cleaned up now
25029,I'll read a little bit of this and then we do something else
25030,well I'm gonna carry my tea and I'm gonna carry
25031,put some here just in case you wanna try it
25032,well he could find bear caves in the along the trail
25033,zat where she was stepping on a blueberry
25034,Naima who told you to put the socks inside the the shoes
25035,and then that's the driver of the bus

25045,you gonna take your juice down and drink it
25046,a house is built at Pooh corner one day when Pooh bear had nothing else to do he thought he would do something so he went around to house to see what Piglet was doing it was still snowing as he stumped over the white forest track and he expected to find Piglet warming his toes in front of his fire
25047,that's why I was giving it to you
25048,I think maybe I'll clear off this table and we can all sit and have breakfast at this table which is a little more comfortable
25049,if I move this you can see them more easily
25050,rabbit emptying a garbage can into the back of the truck
25051,oh that's great should we go get some of those rocks
25052,well if it snows I'll definitely give you that to play with
25053,that's some food that we're gonna take with us to vacation
25054,xxx Sleepy Bear what are you doing in the bucket
25055,I'm gonna give you a smoothie
25056,would you like um oh you know what we don't have any bread
25057,and there's a dog who's also emptying some cans into the truck
25058,I'll go look for it as soon as I put away this salmon
25059,you warming can you pretend to warm your toes in front of the fire
25060,I guess I don't feel like cooking because the amount of dishes that ends up getting generated is just
25061,hey that's a red white and blue truck with a picture of a stamp
25062,I'm gonna take the ones that are on the
25063,xxx but to his surprise he saw the door is open and the more he looked inside the more Piglet wasn't there xxx
25064,well I'm trying to find a good place for it
25065,oh gee I'm not sure I know which ones those are
25066,Mommy's eating salmon do you wanna try some
25067,it's like three meals a day for four people is like constant cooking and cleaning up
25068,I would like you to tell me if you need to use the potty
25069,he's out said Pooh sadly that's what it is he's not in I shall have to go a fast thinking walk by myself bother
25070,does he like to look at himself in the mirror
25071,she's putting her own spoon in that jar so we have_to
25072,what are the books that the children that the bird children are gonna be listening to today at the library
25073,'cause I see he stuffed something else in the wine bottle
25074,I think this would be make some very nice water for Kawadee Head
25075,it was a present because you said it was Griz's birthday
25076,that's a truck that has a broom attached to it to make the streets clean
25077,I didn't know it was Mommy Day
25078,she drew her name and she drew what kind of an animal
25079,here let's put this back in where it goes
25080,you could use the knife to try to get out the jam
25081,you gonna hold me with your messy hands
25082,so we made a present for him to have at his party
25083,don't forget you have your water to help wash down whatever you're eating
25084,do you wanna little cracker with your hummus or are you just gonna just use the spoon
25085,there's a truck for digging holes says Huckle
25086,hold onto the jar with one hand and then put the knife in
25087,that's what Pooh says that's just an expression he has
25088,okay I think you wanna try this kinda cracker
25089,um I think that he's in the office doing stress tests
25090,but first he thought he would knock very loudly just to make quite sure and while he waited for Piglet not to answer he jumped up and down to keep warm can you do that
25091,and I have been wiping the tomato sauce off
25092,that's not how we eat jam we eat jam on toast
25093,now because it was a little bit smelly that's why
25094,hoo_woo go the sirens as three fire engines zoom by
25095,it comes off of you and it goes onto the
25096,that's called Jungle Animals I think there's another farm animal book
25097,why don't you come sit down drink your smoothie
25098,I wonder if they are rushing to a fire says Huckle
25099,a crumb of egg yolk not a piece of egg yolk
25100,that's called Jungle Animals what's that in your hand
25101,and then you can brush your teeth and then you can have a yoga card and then we could do some yoga
25102,I think we might need more track let's find out
25103,and a hum came suddenly into his head which seemed to him a good hum such as is a hum hopefully to others the more it snows tidily pom the more it goes tidily pom the more it goes tidily pom on snow wing and nobody knows tidily pom how cold my toes tidily pom how cold my toes tidil pom are growing
25104,somehow eating the salmon makes you wanna hold on to me
25105,I'm gonna dry your hands off a little bit
25106,actually I didn't think that was a vulture
25107,well to come this far up most people will wanna spend more than a weekend
25108,it would be a good idea if you had a bath tonight
25109,it doesn't sound like a vulture I'm gonna drink some orange juice
25110,but and we'll need xxx like less of advance notice to
25111,oh let's see today I have cement mixers in my shirt
25112,the ones that are other colors aren't always postures
25113,lemme put these animals back and then we'll look for Carwin
25114,let's put your backpack on because you know what you're carrying your picnic lunch in it
25115,you're on a hike you were on a hike to Kawadee Head and you need to still carry your lunch
25116,some of those are about different ways you can breathe
25117,did you know that there are different ways to breathe
25118,that's exactly what I was doing
25119,well it's not very good something is not quite right here I think we need one more piece of curved track Naima it's gotta go right there
25120,I'm gonna spread the almond butter on the Kamut cakes
25121,why no they are going to Tina Trucker's birthday party
25122,oh who's gonna sit in the rocking chair
25123,with a knife then I'm gonna give it to you to eat
25124,I think there's a dentist and a dental hygienist in that book
25125,where'r you gonna push Griz to on his very fun ride
25126,or you can breathe in with your mouth and out through your nose
25127,the placement of words in question formation is occasionally correct now

25137,so are you sure you don't need to poop at all Naima
25138,and look there's a present in the back of the dump truck
25139,that's very strange for a little bear to do that all by himself
25140,then we can look through it for another curved piece
25141,oh I'm trying to remember which one that is
25142,because bears don't usually walk around department stores all by themselves after dark
25143,y'want me to see if there's nursies

25153,yes we took your shoes off and it was a bear walk and it went up too
25154,does he drink bottles of milk or does he just nurse
25155,he was trying to look for the button
25156,let me wipe that off of your leg where it spilled
25157,um because he knows that the people who are in the store who want to buy a little bear he hears them say that they want bears who don't have lost buttons they want bears who already have their buttons
25158,it was like bear walking up a hill
25159,he was eating it right from your hand like a bird
25160,and you wanna have some more smoothie too

25180,Doggy Woggy made that scratch on the wall long long time ago
25181,and I'm gonna put your seat belt on okay
25182,oh boy does he know that or is it going to be a surprise

25200,a duck with two ducklings and a little rabbit for Carrots
25201,I just put this on you even though I didn't
25202,and you wanted to see what his high+chair looked like
25203,oh yes he does have a lot of activities today
25204,well I'm trying to plug this camera into the wall
25205,Naima would you like to take Sleepy Bear down to breakfast with you today
25206,oh I remember there was something funny you used to say when we read this book
25207,it's called my painted house my friendly chicken and me
25208,I believe he came with us in the car when we went to gym class for him that was probably a lot of activity even though he didn't come in with us
25209,I shouldn'a put it on because you have the
25210,it looks the same kinda restaurant um high+chair that restaurants usually use
25211,you can have them out of this bowl if you want
25212,let's see I don't know quite how this would work here
25213,you think Griz would like to listen to that music
25214,doesn't it look like the house is painted
25215,well he has one that's like a restaurant high+chair but he uses it at home
25216,I'll get a little lotion and I'll give you a little foot massage
25217,Carrots has some big friends and some little friends
25218,yes xxx wash why don't you wash your hands at the sink now too okay
25219,but he has three cause he has one on each foot and then there's one attached to his tail
25220,I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea I hear the water boiling
25221,I knew you were gonna ask me that question
25222,there's a certain page were you used to say
25223,hello stranger friend I am Tondie a Nibilay girl in south Africa
25224,wanna wanna count all the animals
25225,what happen oh they didn't yogurt stick at the store I know
25226,now it's probably time to get a dry diaper doncha think
25227,xxx that foot that's been running around want a little massage
25228,okay sometimes Pippo gets lost and Tom has to look for him
25229,ah that's good I'm glad to hear that he's not allergic do you have to poop some more because you can sit right on your potty
25230,I'm eight years old and my best friend look at all the necklaces she's wearing
25231,because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego
25232,if you're walking around it would be a good idea to uh
25233,I think that means that he's listening to music
25234,I was very disappointed and I bet you were too
25235,that's how many animals stuffed animals Kim has I think
25236,and she has a head necklace around her head too
25237,to wear it and put the transmitter in it
25238,if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable
25239,I can't wait to hear it I'm gonna come listen in just a minute
25240,Naima Mommy is asking you do you need to sit on the potty
25241,I think this is a book where lots_of things are going to happen
25242,I think I just cleaned you up like a baby but I think your hands still have some residue on them
25243,I'm eight years old and my best friend is a chicken
25244,see this is wider and this is skinny and narrow
25245,that is something people say when they're disappointed you're right
25246,Naima we might go in a little while and bring xxx shoes back to her
25247,you could carry Olivia and the transmitter in it
25248,poops more okay you can get up and do that now
25249,she doesn't squash the worm in that book I don't think so
25250,if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable
25251,he's throwing the matches over here and he's lighting his presents on fire
25252,then what're ya gonna eat after that
25253,is she too little to have a transmitter
25254,I'm not sure if we're gonna see her though that's the only thing
25255,well I'm not going to because it's too soft
25256,xxx why do you think it's good to keep toys off the stairs
25257,that if I were you I'd put that on the bottom
25258,so you can sit on your potty you can poops more if you want
25259,well um you know Amanda and Katherine sent us that for the transmitter but I think they wouldn't mind if Olivia also rides in it
25260,I had quite a lot of Cheez_Whiz in my time
25261,Tom asks Mommy if she has seen Pippo and she says Tom should look in his toy chest again
25262,'cause that's really stable that's like a platform

25460,we're gonna put these in the freezer
25461,I'm taking the seeds out of this pepper this red
25462,but you just pooped right before supper so I'm not sure your body had any more poop in it
25463,how many dolphins do you see jumping out of the water
25464,actually it's also spicy so you might not like it
25465,cause they're not toys and they're not to be eaten at all
25466,the scary dinosaur jumped over and then we need a we need a the over the woman right
25467,I think I will make a little bit of pasta you could have some

25469,'cause I'm cleaning it to get ready to cook it
25470,I see can you have a little more lentils please
25471,right there are two dolphins jumping out of the water
25472,we don't really eat the seeds usually
25473,ooh we're gonna have spicy food tonight
25474,you burped and it's good manners to say excuse me when you burp
25475,if I can find a pot to cook it in that's not dirty
25476,mm the seeds tend to be spicy and the texture doesn't feel very good in your mouth if you have pepper seeds
25477,she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear
25478,that's good one except here's this one with the small t that has a capital t
25479,would you like some almond butter on a piece of bread
25480,we saw a I don't know what you call it a special kind of truck for beaches
25481,we'll see if there's anything else good to eat in here
25482,stomping in puddles splashes and laughter my favorite part of a storm is the after
25483,some things don't have a nice texture to eat
25484,it was actually it was scooping up the sand in this part of it
25485,I will read one flap book to you and then I have_to check something on the computer
25486,oh why don't the bird children pick out some books now
25487,I think when they're frozen they're specially good
25488,but anyway you're only going getting yourself to the xxx ferry xxx
25489,and then it was putting it through like a sieve almost and it was taking all the garbage out of the sand and also flattening the sand
25490,and you know what comes at the end of a sentence I didn't tell you this before a period
25491,you could help them pick out which ones they like
25492,it's that nice bread and I will put some almond butter on yours for you
25493,well don't you want to flush it down the potty
25494,it was kinda like a road roller for the beach
25495,and at the end of a sentence you usually have a period
25496,yes yeah I mean people might do that actually but there might be weekend commuters xxx that's a good point who just have summer places
25497,if an adult isn't home don't let strangers into the house
25498,they read books they pick out books to take home
25499,and the rice has a different texture it has a bumpy texture doesn't it
25500,that was one time when we were at Craigville beach
25501,after this song I'm turning this song off because
25502,there's a car is there a truck at the beach today
25503,sometimes you go and you talk to the librarian about something
25504,but we don't say period but it's there to tell you that it's the end of the sentence
25505,oh and then is he having the snack of blueberries when he's home
25506,you still eating your hummus or are you finished with it
25507,it really is time to brush teeth now

25510,he's done so he's just gonna sit in my lap and read
25511,would you please pick up the tissue paper and put it all in the garbage
25512,blueberries in the car I bet that makes a big mess
25513,once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll house

25515,I mean there's toast and there's jam I don't
25516,do you want almond butter on some bread or would you rather have
25517,well when you put yours in the potty you can pretend you put his in too
25518,it was red brick with white windows and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney
25519,and Naima's picking up the tissue paper and putting xxx in the garbage
25520,the one six seven but the period is not actually a word
25521,can you can you bring this over and give it to her and and try to wave it in front of her face or something
25522,because it's a fun way to ride see you can make them ride
25523,at least she was last time I checked
25524,cause we're gonna make saag which is a very nice spicy dish and we're gonna have spicy fish too
25525,I bet the unions wouldn't like it though
25526,during a thunderstorm stay out of water and away from trees
25527,wee she's riding the waves on a surf board
25528,'cause I'm gonna sit right there and read to you
25529,with those orange and purple letters that are on the truck
25530,the life the lifeguard watches people who are in the water and makes sure they're safe
25531,oh he must be a very little bear to make such a big mess

25533,I may have_to go soon because she's a little on the sleepy side and
25534,oh you're right there's hardly any syrup
25535,only little kids make really big messes
25536,and actually I didn't get this and I forgot to find out what it's called
25537,is that seat belt too tight around your waist or is it okay

25542,last year I was Gospal the dog walker
25543,outside when we drive up and we look at our house and we're still in the car and we're going to go in the house what color is the outside of the house
25544,but beds don't climb or see or eat or anything let's start with a creature like a person or animal
25545,when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
25546,you want me to take the crust off or you gonna eat the crust
25547,and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
25548,because they know that it's good to put them right in your mouth
25549,these are the different houses that the different animals live in
25550,well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was from yesterday
25551,you know where he is and what he's doing I think
25552,she's coming off the bus isn't she
25553,but some people are in between young and old

25561,well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it

25569,I think most of the magnets are actually in the car in that box that's in the backseat
25570,well I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down
25571,actually we should have asked Ben and Sonya if they
25572,it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane
25573,let's see if I can actually read it in two weeks xxx
25574,every one at school wanted it but it was mine
25575,at least it belonged to Lucinda but she never ordered meals
25576,I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my
25577,well because this was something that you were playing with a lot in the car
25578,and there're some adjective too I'll explain what those are
25579,I'm gonna cut it into pieces and then let it cool down
25580,but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings
25581,I didn't say it had a rock in it
25582,he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope
25583,who is gonna jump into the neighbors
25584,there're some adjectives like hairy and happy and sad and blue

25589,I'm just gonna put this here okay
25590,and it's a little bit cooler than it is now
25591,'cause we didn't sign in the day we came either
25592,a fish a pudding and some pears and oranges
25593,I don't know if we're looking at the same one but I see one right by the fence here
25594,full oh that was a great one when Daddy said that
25595,it's gonna take him quite a while to get there isn't it
25596,Naima what did you say this morning when you wanted to switch sides
25597,'cause we're gonna wear them when we go
25598,they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful
25599,what do you think the teacher is trying to do
25600,I don't think he does that a lot but I think once in a while maybe he does that
25601,are you wanting me to go out of the kitchen
25602,what what kind of a blue thing did he see
25603,one morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the dolls perambulator
25604,you sure you don't wanna wait for the pasta to be ready
25605,Griz do you have enough gas in your box to take you to all the way to Maine
25606,the man saw a blue monkey is that the end of our sentence
25607,what do you think the teacher is trying to do
25608,there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet
25609,this is what it looks like before it gets cooked
25610,I was gonna put a period here
25611,oh you better stop at the gas station on your way to Maine then
25612,I can tell because they have blueberry stains on them
25613,presently there was a little scuffling scratching noise
25614,what happens in his house in the mornings this is what happens in his house in the mornings
25615,in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board
25616,and chili's also gonna have black beans in it
25617,while he was using a knife to slice this orange
25618,one two three four five six words in that sentence
25619,the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell
25620,Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again
25621,and we're gonna eat it for supper later on
25622,but he kept talking and he didn't realize he sliced the toaster in half also
25623,oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain
25624,'casue I'm gonna cook it in that pan
25625,well actually you have a white shirt to wear today
25626,you need to start saying please a little more often though
25627,I think that's a building that's being built there
25628,the thing is there's no yogurt left for her
25629,I would be very startled if I saw a blue monkey
25630,well right now it's just onions it's not that interesting
25631,I usually will play a game with you if you will say please but
25632,oh what kind of toys does Christopher Robin have
25633,we don't have any blue shirts with us I don't think
25634,see this is gonna be the second floor of the building and this might be the first floor of the building
25635,it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
25636,when it's all cooking everything's in it you can have a look at it
25637,a minute afterwards Hunka Munka his wife put out her head too
25638,well doesn't it taste a little bit like muffin
25639,well there's sauce all over it but the part I'm giving you is cheesy part anyway
25640,cause he was looking at someone else and talking to someone else
25641,were there any animals at the aquarium that you had never seen before
25642,I don't know what that is it's a piece of bread dough that must of coming off come off your toes or clothing
25643,I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here
25644,and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box
25645,it's like a blueberry muffin that's what I thought
25646,if you have a knife in your hand you can't do that
25647,do you remember there there were puppets at that library
25648,oh can't we just talk about the pictures a little
25649,and there was there were Max and Ruby stuffed animals too
25650,you have_to look at the knife and be very careful with what you're doing
25651,the dolls' house stood at the other side of the fireplace
25652,Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went cautiously across the hearth rug
25653,Timothy was all ready for school Timothy's mother asked where is your green backpack
25654,I think we'll feed her Oaty_Os blueberries and soy milk
25655,not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room
25656,it doesn't really snow in the summer
25657,oh it was resting from having rides
25658,that dinosaur's mouth is hurting because he ate something that was too hot
25659,and one along this edge and then it will be a building
25660,that's the special water going into patient's body
25661,just summer is not a time when there's snow
25662,I think it was easier for you to say than gesundheit
25663,did you know that buildings usually have
25664,Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went upstairs and peeped into the dining room
25665,was it having a break from giving rides
25666,you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember
25667,I don't mean hot and spicy I mean hot temperaturewise
25668,winter fall and spring are the only time when it snows
25669,a regular building usually has four walls
25670,I'll eat the other part you can have the crust part
25671,you wanna sit up and I'll put this on
25672,I'm also making a little bit of spaghetti so you can have some spaghetti also
25673,okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself
25674,I'm gonna get some bread and butter to eat
25675,such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table
25676,that book has an itty bitty mouse in it
25677,I always thought that was a funny thing to say
25678,the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
25679,we have very little room for things that need refrigerating
25680,there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs all so convenient
25681,don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt
25682,tomorrow we're gonna play with xxx in the morning
25683,I forgot we're gonna need to change your diaper very soon
25684,I think right now I'm gonna do some more cleaning up in the kitchen
25685,if it's not raining then we'll go to Old Townhouse Park
25686,but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x_ray room
25687,he was actually he was giving you little hugs
25688,Naima do you wanna have some more smoothie or some juice maybe
25689,Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham
25690,he wanted to touch you and give you hugs
25691,cause that's a really nice play+ground and we don't go there very often
25692,and he actually give you a kiss on your back he's a very sneaky kisser
25693,you might not remember you did get x_rays couple of times
25694,why are you even looking at this silly site
25695,it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red
25696,I used to say that to you all the time
25697,um no that was the end of it actually
25698,you could have a sippy cup or a bottle of juice
25699,here's a fish I don't think kangaroos eat fish
25700,that's his x_ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there
25701,I used to say googalee when you were a little little baby
25702,xxx a slide and monkey bars and a swing+set is in the box
25703,he likes to sneak up behind people and kiss them on the back of their head
25704,and you know what you would do when I did that
25705,if it's raining hard then we'll probably do something different but we'll do something with xxx
25706,it is not boiled enough it is hard
25707,the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said
25708,well I kinda need to finish doing what I'm doing here
25709,well that's something you'll learn when you get a little older
25710,I used to make you giggle a lot when you were a little baby
25711,oh aren't you gonna have some of the spaghetti
25712,Hunka Munka stood up on her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife
25713,I need to put away these dishes and put the dirty ones in the dish washer
25714,where did he get it was it did it come in the mail or did he bring it back from Maine
25715,did you hear me leave that message for his mommy
25716,it's as hard as the hams at the cheese monger's
25717,well we'll talk about that another time but not right at bedtime
25718,let's see if we can do that for a minute
25719,Hunka Munka isn't that a funny name
25720,'cause you would do funny things and make funny faces
25721,I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver xxx
25722,twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven
25723,the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table
25724,he's saying please can I get the other side
25725,they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
25726,I'm gonna move you away from the stove 'cause I'm gonna use the stove
25727,there are twenty eight cards on the floor all lined up
25728,he's asking in a nice way isn't he
25729,because I need to talk to her about it first and that's only if it's not
25730,do you think kangaroos really eat whole trees
25731,my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big
25732,Hunka Munka tried every tin spoon in turn the fish was glued to the dish
25733,d'you wanna put your socks on and pick blueberries
25734,I'm gonna do a little more cleaning up in the kitchen
25735,if it's not raining we're gonna go to the play+ground
25736,then Tom Thumb lost his temper he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs
25737,does he live with other bears or does he live by himself
25738,inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it
25739,I know some other animal that likes to eat eucalyptus
25740,yeah that's not really a very important part of the
25741,the one in the living room you were talking about
25742,because I'm gonna use this other burner on the stove
25743,we could go to the car and get the other ones too
25744,xxx you wanna see how it taste like when it's frozen
25745,I found Daddy's really nice gloves that I think I gave Daddy last year or the year before just now

25764,if Daddy asks you about the school you visited today what are you gonna tell him about it

25766,maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home
25767,well we don't have the word painted here unfortunately
25768,you could get down and go over where your books are and pick one out for them
25769,we don't have a salty cheese though that's the problem
25770,if he says what was it like at that school what do you think you will say

25772,you wouldn't want her to poke you with her horns right

25786,that's to tell people how much the book cost
25787,you know what I'm going to do while I'm in Maine
25788,are you examining each tooth carefully

25824,little bears just eat blueberries without thinking about whether they're making their clothes dirty
25825,well there's some in the box the organic ones
25826,um I think just the way you normally have it is fine
25827,I don't think you're peeing or pooping are you
25828,and then go out to the car I guess I'm not gonna take a shower for awhile
25829,cavity is a hole in your tooth that you get when your teeth are really rotten
25830,I just changed her because she asked me to a little while ago
25831,or some people might call it a dog carrier
25832,I am definitely going to see you tomorrow morning there's no question about it
25833,ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital
25834,well that's the ones washed left over that aren't organic but you could give those to her I guess
25835,I thought you were gonna help wrap presents anyway
25836,that's a hero it's a kind of a sandwich called a hero
25837,well xxx you might be shy but that's not to play with

25851,it's evening and foxes go about in the evening in the dark
25852,are you done or are you still eating that apple
25853,she's surprised that something got burned I think
25854,glue is for gluing things to something else it's not for making glue soup
25855,you can say the or the it doesn't matter
25856,he's supposed to come out only if someone comes to let him out
25857,everyone at school wanted it but it was mine

25863,that has a lot of vitamin c in it as you may know
25864,well dentists use the name doctor in front of their names sometimes
25865,I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key+chain in my mouth
25866,I'm making small amount of that angel hair pasta
25867,there's Naima and we're gonna wrap presents
25868,people use to take animals from one place to another
25869,cause a dentist is really a tooth doctor
25870,either you or I use the calling card and the phone downstairs to
25871,then you need to say the mouse instead of the hero
25872,do you see any birds at the feeder
25873,okay on this there's only been about five or ten minutes
25874,well I think Japanese honey suckle berries we don't eat
25875,it is falling down in this picture when you move the tab it starts to fall down
25876,oh the tool for looking in the mouth is on the floor
25877,we are going to leave to go on our journey right after breakfast

25881,he's cleaning up the room maybe they were on the floor
25882,make sure this is gonna be the right size
25883,oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though
25884,because the puppy is using his teeth to
25885,he's up in the tree and he falls down out of the tree
25886,you know may be we could write stole here instead
25887,yeah today we saw puddles in the potholes
25888,xxx xxx Naima can you tell me what the date is today
25889,I'm going to go tell the big barn cat
25890,yes so it has like a hole a large hole in it
25891,this says climbed but we don't have any that say stole but that's a good one
25892,that was just a joke that xxx made quite a long time ago
25893,do you remember how we did it earlier today
25894,you know you could say Mommy read this please instead of just saying do this
25895,hi little tiny baby that came out of her mama's belly
25896,I think because it had rained a few days ago
25897,someone's bringing a mop but it's too late
25898,what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key+chain
25899,just recently but it did rain a few days ago
25900,if someone had mopped up that water before then daddy cat wouldn't have slipped
25901,maybe when xxx comes she can also cut out pictures for you
25902,I can wait I actually have some at home right now so
25903,well you know xxx might even use a potty most of the time like you do
25904,I think the puppy didn't know there were so many things in the closet that were going to come falling out when he opened the door
25905,I'm gonna write toy down here on our list
25906,here's the we need a word on then don't we
25907,I think I'll slice up this bread so that it's all sliced
25908,well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key+chain
25909,the fox came and tried to take away the barn cat
25910,well I don't know it just was still there
25911,she can't stop him from slipping by mopping it up
25912,I hope you don't have 'em in those pockets that you keep losing stuff out of
25913,well she's getting to be a bigger kid like you are
25914,if it's really rotten we might have_to pull it out but I don't think it's that bad
25915,when we go on our journey tomorrow do you wannna bring what's my job and so you can show it to Grandma and play it with her
25916,but the fox went away and did not take away the kitten
25917,right that says the actually do you want a or the
25918,hm I think it was a little boy who put them out
25919,they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
25920,well she had a tiny tiny amount not anything to call nutrition
25921,oh that's a good one do you need one of these
25922,I think it might be time to have a small snack
25923,the daddy's gonna go to work now
25924,well there's a t in the middle of the word mustard
25925,I don't really know if xxx using a potty
25926,actually it doesn't have any xxx words to read
25927,you wouldn't wanna eat watery pasta wou'jou
25928,it was a little hard to explain why I put a key+chain in my mouth
25929,and then make a crease with your hand all the way here
25930,garbage bags and we should buy eggs so that we can eat eggs today
25931,hm we need might need some special other tools for that
25932,well she knows about first and second she's probably putting two and two together
25933,I can just put some on the table for you
25934,well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much
25935,that's a show about an elephant isn't it
25936,oh he's gonna work down in the basement

25964,I think we might actually need something to carry them back in here with don't you think
25965,us is cozy so I was just joking that it was cozy for the letter t to be in between in the middle of all those other letters
25966,we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road
25967,this might be a little warm still even though the sauce is on it

25984,I'm not talking about the tour I'm not gonna go
25985,I think that's probably all of the tape
25986,I don't know that we can fit more than that in that cooler
25987,they're playing they like to play with things like toilet paper
25988,this is how you feel you get upset about things

25992,you mean like the name of the cat in Mrs McCats
25993,you wanna stay in the house while I get them

26019,I didn't know that was his favorite
26020,oh y'know it would make a lot more sense to get the blueberries except we'll have_to buy
26021,this way you can move them in and out if you need to
26022,but imonna help you look for those uh tongs now but I do want to keep talking to you about a nap because I know that when you take a nap sometimes it helps you feel better
26023,it's a tiny little patch of dry skin somewhere down there
26024,it actually is raining a little tiny bit
26025,it looks like you have a little food on your sleeve here
26026,bring it up to where the edge of the present inside the wrapping is
26027,we could put two of these together to make his desk
26028,they wanna come out and get fresh air and eat green don't they
26029,did you see someone opening it with keys
26030,your diaper looks like it might need a little bit of changing
26031,and you also have a little bit of dry skin on your shoulders
26032,are you gonna eat those cookies by the way
26033,oh you know what this one is broken it doesn't work

26035,I do it's the page that has to do with counting
26036,it was the teacher from the Waldorf school
26037,and this one is also broken and doesn't work at all
26038,Naima's thinking of when Mommy was telling the Goldilocks story
26039,I think it would be a really good idea to have a bath and you could
26040,let's oh and these were big kid pants weren't they I think the big kid pants are wet
26041,you were there so early that they hadn't even opened yet
26042,she said I'm looking forward to seeing you
26043,you know we could build it and then we could slide it underneath after we build it
26044,whoa puppy's falling whoa puppy's falling whoa
26045,what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story
26046,oh I have dry skin all over the place especially on my hands
26047,we're not gonna play in the sandbox the whole time
26048,how about if you just get your big kid pants off
26049,I'm going to carry this kitten back to where it belongs
26050,why don't you come and eat your cereal with Naima so that I can do a few things that I wanna do
26051,yes there are four children waiting for buses
26052,we're gonna do some special things and I think we're gonna have circle time
26053,uh yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be uh
26054,but while we're building it we can keep it right here if we want to
26055,and then this says you sure are trouble Puppy
26056,I wonder if they're in the kitchen with all your other
26057,here take some off my hands and put it on my
26058,you gonna have_to do a tickle stretch actually because the play suit is wet too
26059,and there will be some other children and other mommies and daddies there
26060,put it on the back of my hands right there
26061,you know you did pee in here I don't know if you realize it
26062,are you going to eat any of those cookies
26063,oops and I'm gonna take the whole play suit off
26064,you know what we're gonna need to go for a drive in a little while because we don't have any yogurt xxx
26065,you don't need too much just need enough to keep the flap down it doesn't have_to be
26066,I'm not gonna be shut off anytime
26067,it's the same Lubriderm that came out of that bottle
26068,this block almost look like a treadmill if it was this way
26069,no the answer to the question is there are two police officers
26070,xxx look out is something you say if someone or something is falling it means
26071,it's still a problem in terms of the timing of the trip
26072,do you wanna use the magnetic letters or the block letters
26073,there's no yogurt in our house except for the baby yogurt that's the flavor that you don't like
26074,that amount of sticking up is actually okay
26075,look what's happening move out of the way so you don't
26076,'cause we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get
26077,you may clean your hands oops that's not gonna clean them
26078,that's true it doesn't have a hold in it
26079,turn it so that the tape is on the bottom
26080,the ducky rides on the top of the bathtub
26081,xxx this is the microphone part is this part right here xxx
26082,so I think it would be good if we went in the car
26083,yeah that's the present for Grandma it look very nice
26084,and that back there is the transmitter in your pocket
26085,are there any bears in that one maybe he'd like it if there were bears in it
26086,at least a little bit do you need to pee some more
26087,all those pages should've been attached when the book was made
26088,now I'm gonna put this box together to wrap the hat and gloves for Grandma
26089,kind of like you know to go up to the side that he holds onto I thought I would make that part
26090,you know what it's almost becoming time to brush teeth Naima
26091,when you're ready to go to bed I'll sing it
26092,looks like you have hardly any room to glue anything else
26093,do you need to pee any more you wanna sit on the potty
26094,I know this is a fun game but we have_to start thinking about getting ready for bed
26095,oh right right right I know what you're talking about
26096,xxx let's play that guessing game that we played last night
26097,oh you can pretend the other is one there you know
26098,that's a picture of a kid isn't it
26099,okay the chickens and roosters are all in the chicken coop
26100,it's hard for me to keep up with you Boo
26101,because I thought you know like he when he walks on the treadmill
26102,there was lots to do Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
26103,that tells you you need to turn it around and open it on that side
26104,he's not looking at where he's putting the brush
26105,no I'm not looking for flap books right now not at not not at
26106,it's wool but it's lined with fleece so it's not scratchy
26107,he's looking in front of him he's not looking at where he's putting the brush
26108,so can you find any pictures of a fire truck
26109,well you know when you're on the potty you shouldn't really touch sleepy because you have_to have clean hands
26110,I'm thinking of something that's in this room that begins with letter b
26111,you're gonna need a lot of glue for that one
26112,but do you wanna read it to sleepy
26113,oh you mean in your um in your book rack you didn't
26114,well I'm just talking to the person who's gonna transcribe
26115,I thought we could use this for something but now I'm not so sure
26116,we may be having battery problems but I think
26117,I think you should may be come off the potty
26118,this is still November twenty fifth just moments later
26119,can I just see if that's gonna fit you that's too short for you
26120,sometimes I get distracted and I say the wrong thing or I do the wrong thing
26121,well I'm not gonna read it 'cause I'm eating my breakfast
26122,it's something that is soft when it gets warm
26123,you have eczema which is not just dry skin but skin that's peeling a little bit
26124,I just tested that and they seem to be all okay so
26125,so it can kinda doesn't this kinda look like the treadmill
26126,I was thinking we might give this dress to xxx it might be too small for you shall we just take a look
26127,alright well I don't see the fire truck that one is missing
26128,I guess I'm gonna put the gloves inside the hat
26129,we should be able to make some kind of game out of this box
26130,the cat's not here in the chicken coop good night chickens good night roosters
26131,I'm gonna put the cookies away
26132,well then you'd need an s and I don't have an s here
26133,this is actually a letter to Clare xxx mother
26134,Lucy's still gonna hide in that box huh
26135,I won't put it on you but I wanna hold it up against you
26136,I think maybe you used the stickers for something else
26137,give me a hint or do you want me to give you another one
26138,oh Daddy there must be a fly over your way somewhere
26139,does Sleepy Bear's mommy eat grown+up food usually
26140,well that's I think it looks kinda like the treadmill
26141,and I'm gonna put it up here with some other mail
26142,let me see if I can figure out what's hurting
26143,Veena and Pushba are tired farmers who'd like to go to bed
26144,it's the material that Paddington's suitcase is made out of
26145,then he has uh he has a sofa right here doesn't he
26146,oh that would be quite short that barely covers your bottom
26147,well I'd like to make a game out of this box
26148,let's see this is apples or strawberries right
26149,and then we'll wrap the box in some wrapping paper
26150,I'm gonna take the pigs into the barn now
26151,that's how you know you're a baby in that picture
26152,I'm thinking of something in this room that begins with letter w do you know what sound letter w makes
26153,you know you could put it on your own body
26154,that's the word puppy in blue and I see a sticker that has
26155,yeah you're in your baby bunting actually
26156,let me see let me hold it up against this part of you
26157,xxx Sal and her mother take some pails and go to Blueberry Hill don't they
26158,just yeah let me get a little bit more here
26159,what kind of a game could we make from this box
26160,okay you can get some clothes pins if you want
26161,the one that's a pull+out sofa that great+grandma slept on when she was with us
26162,there seems to be no s in this bag of cookies
26163,well I'm just thinking if we stand it upright
26164,let me just look and see if I can see anything
26165,that's what your old letter to him says it says I went right to a party
26166,and there's shoes I bet there's a blue word shoes somewhere let's look for a blue word because there's a pair of shoes
26167,it's something that lets us see the trees
26168,it's such an interesting box with these oval shapes
26169,actually they're more like oblongs than ovals I guess
26170,I see g a q a c an n an r
26171,alright I'm gonna put them right here because I need to finish putting your shirt on
26172,her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter
26173,it's too small 'cause you've gotten bigger
26174,no it's the back of my hand that's really dry
26175,that's a good idea that's not what I had in mind
26176,it it doesn't look like there's anything wrong there honey
26177,is she gonna be in the back seat in her car+seat
26178,s h o e s you can put those right on that word
26179,I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars
26180,so he didn't have anything stinging because he didn't have any boo+boos even though he ate with his hands
26181,that's not a nice way to ask is it
26182,you can have them they are right here go ahead and take them
26183,can you sort the silverware for me is that something you could do right now
26184,let me see that's not big enough over there so
26185,back at the street fair the clown with balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
26186,on the stove and put it in jars and then store it keep it so that they will have blueberries all year round
26187,yes that's what I've been trying to tell you
26188,I need to think about this box but I guess if I have_to I'll cut out more pictures
26189,mm okay I'm gonna come along with you
26190,yep you're gonna help but let me cut the right size of paper first
26191,there does that kinda look like that's a sofa
26192,sleepy likes water does he like to find salmon in his water
26193,and as he fell he let go of his balloons
26194,but there's another reason not to eat with your hands
26195,we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer
26196,here's a little thing to squirt water in their mouth
26197,there's a fox who lives near the farm uhoh
26198,Griz is in here you wanna have no diaper for a little while
26199,then guess what a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings
26200,there is but I'm singing it in the wrong
26201,even if you don't have boo+boos you might decide to eat with a fork and a spoon
26202,oh that's the Mommy book isn't it that's my book
26203,oh that would be something to do with it yeah
26204,I was trying to figure out where to put your microphone here
26205,I think it would be better if you had no diaper for a while
26206,I'm pretending that's the part that you sit on and this is the back of the sofa
26207,no I'm not gonna put more Lubriderm on it
26208,because that's a song that I can never remember the right notes to
26209,I was thinking something more like a game
26210,I think it would be a good pretend thing that squirts water into the dental patient's mouth
26211,do we have a sticker that has strings or teeth
26212,cause it's not gonna make it better right
26213,this is a dress that used to be Mommy's when I was little
26214,okay now I am gonna get you a bear bowl
26215,this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries
26216,okay this is our piece of paper for this box
26217,you know why because ah if there's a problem with your bottom your bottom will probably feel better if there's no diaper on for few minutes just for a little while then we put the big kids pants on
26218,it means that when you're finished eating all you have_to do is wipe them a little bit on a napkin
26219,can I hold it up against you and see if it's too small
26220,in fact that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair because 'cause it's probably peak time for picking
26221,and it has some wipes and diapers on it
26222,do you remember what the first thing we should do is
26223,this is the part to lean against that's what I was thinking
26224,he's trying to grab a serving bowl of food
26225,it's not the same kind that's flying around in here right now
26226,I think it probably says Baby Bjorn on it
26227,I'm just gonna try to get the Lubriderm off for you
26228,no actually these are the teeth look
26229,I think we'll see if xxx wants that as well
26230,if the doll was there she'd be she'd sit like this
26231,uh we need a coupla other things besides yogurt not a lot though
26232,the nice side of the wrapping paper the side we want to show is actually on the floor
26233,they're both shy about having their picture taken
26234,oh little Sal finds mother crow and her children
26235,you did you did put pee in the potty you can have potty sticker
26236,mm I gotta make xxx really hard I'm thinking of somebody
26237,this is the inside that no one's gonna see
26238,oh he's lying under the table cloth which is a big mess
26239,we won't have any money to buy the yogurt with
26240,would you like to go and get pizza from Sweet Tomatoes and after we drop xxx shoes off
26241,oh this is hard lemme see whose name begins with j
26242,little bear finds a mother partridge I think you're right
26243,why don't you wash your hands that's what I'm gonna do
26244,and then we put our present down on the wrapping paper
26245,and a pen or a pencil to write it down for you
26246,and I'm not exactly sure where to find it
26247,can you let Mommy have a little tiny nap and play by yourself for a minute
26248,I'm thinking of someone whose name begins with j

26250,that's where teeth is and it does begin with letter t
26251,there are a lot of mothers and children in that book don't you think
26252,you can use your regular voice if you want help with something sweetie
26253,Pushba and Veena are going to look for that cat
26254,it's not gonna be wet ice it's just gonna be that cold xxx cold pack from the freezer
26255,I've heard you say that before but I don't know what it means
26256,but when I get some after I finish putting away the dishes then I will write down what you would like me to say to him
26257,Mommy's too sleepy I'm gonna just sleep a little
26258,mm oh_my_goodness it's very teeny tiny pieces of smoked salmon

26277,I'll just look through the book and see if there's any stickers that are
26278,cat what are you doing in the chicken coop
26279,well that's not who I was thinking of you're right xxx your daddy's name begins with xxx
26280,yeah we're gonna read two books and go to xxx
26281,um y'know I could take her cottage garden this morning if you wanna have a little reading morning for yourself and then we could do
26282,oh now it spells well we have_to take this away too now it spells xxx can you say what the letters are
26283,you can be his mommy now and take him to Four Seas
26284,it's highly unusual for a cat like you to be in a chicken coop
26285,I'm gonna put ginger in the saag also
26286,today Huckle has an appointment for a physical check up with Doctor Bones
26287,you wanna have a little bit of orzo with that
26288,yep go ahead and put the tape right there that's good
26289,but I was thinking of someone else whose name begins with xxx
26290,and the sentence is when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
26291,or take him to J P Licks that's the one in Brookline that we liked remember
26292,and I'll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece
26293,I'm not gonna put it on for you
26294,after Huckle takes off his clothes Doctor Bones listens to Huckle's heart through his stethoscope
26295,I just wanna take a shower before I go out but
26296,did you put too much in your mouth is that all alright
26297,let's see if this is okay to put it right here
26298,that's the ice cream restaurant in Brookline that we went to
26299,your heart is thumping very nicely Huckle
26300,no I think I sang the story of the day didn't I
26301,the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape I think
26302,is it the top of your hand that hurts
26303,you can have salmon and orzo together that's a good combination
26304,rub rub rub your hands rub the glue right off them
26305,you put it where you think he'll see it
26306,you have put on a lot of weight since the last time you were here Loli
26307,okay let's try to put this on top cause it might help it feel better
26308,this is a box so it's a little different
26309,red we're still looking for something that's red
26310,there's a little table in our guest bedroom isn't there
26311,all the blue words are covered up already there
26312,would you likes me to grind up some sesame to have on top of this spinach and carrots
26313,it's eight o'clock it's kind of time to brush
26314,you must be eating everything your mother serves you
26315,now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box
26316,somewhere there's a sticker that should be a picture of strings
26317,who was wearing a green turtleneck shirt today
26318,maybe we can also just remind him that we put it there
26319,your teeth but if you are hungry I would like to give you something more to eat
26320,if I put it without putting this cloth over it it would probably be too cold
26321,you hafta stay still and you hafta smile and you hafta ask him to smile
26322,that's a picture of me nursing you when you were just born
26323,were you gonna do something with Sleepy Bear
26324,are you interested in having anything more to eat Naima
26325,I must give you a shot to keep you well and healthy
26326,well cause it just came out of the freezer
26327,okay I'm holding this will you put some tape
26328,come off the stool that's you can look at them Mommy wants to lock the door that's all
26329,you gonna hold the handle of the stroller to show that you're strolling him in the picture
26330,it may hurt a little bit but only for a second
26331,we don't wanna cover all the edges with tape we just wanna use
26332,oh would you like a tissue to blow it with
26333,let's see that the little lego people fit in these little slots here
26334,I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon
26335,well I think that would be at least a little bit interesting
26336,Naima stop leaning on that stand back away you can look at them just don't touch this thing okay
26337,come here I wanna look at your hand in the light for a second
26338,this is a very nice jacket I don't wanna give it to xxx unless it really doesn't fit you
26339,can you pick up the ones that're on the mat now and put them
26340,did you see that I put the water colors and papers out for whenever you're ready
26341,and xxx when he came in he was wearing a new orange jacket
26342,that's not really a word but that's what it would sound like if it was a word
26343,does that feel better now or is it still hurting
26344,I'm not gonna touch it I'm just gonna look at it
26345,after Veena finds the cat and finds Pushba then we'll go have a cookie and some milk
26346,see there's a lower case r that starts the word
26347,you know what I think it actually does fit you
26348,I'm a mommy who's about to go buy yogurt so that her child could eat yogurt tonight
26349,you know what you might need to use the potty sometimes that can make your tummy hurt
26350,hm I wonder if I will find anything unusual in my chicken coop this evening
26351,in your room let's go back to your room and play trains that's what xxx
26352,I'd like you to pick up the blueberries which are perfectly good to eat over here and either eat them or put them in your yogurt
26353,it's a cold day today that's why he had it on
26354,well it's just kind of a mean thing to say that's all
26355,I think I'm gonna change your diaper now okay
26356,yeah I think actually a bunch of these things go there
26357,well Huckle says Doctor Bones it has been a pleasure to examine such a fine healthy boy as you
26358,right on the edge and I'll put one little piece right here too
26359,I just wanted to see if it still fits and it does
26360,my hair clips are coming undone
26361,alright let me grind up some walnuts for you
26362,and it's a dark day it's not a sunny day
26363,pick them up and put them in the yogurt or eat them okay
26364,let the chicken sleep they need to get their sleep kitten
26365,let see I will do it in the blender
26366,oh I'll do a couple more people you want people is that more fun
26367,well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we label these and and wrap them with ribbons and things so that
26368,well that's the way to grind up walnuts in this house so far
26369,keep eating properly and I am sure that you will be much bigger on your next visit
26370,I'm thinking of someone whose name begins with
26371,I'm gonna see if there are any more legos in the toy bag 'cause some might have gone
26372,oh you made that circle what train will go on that circle
26373,oh boy I'm gonna have_to think okay I'm thinking of someone whose name begins with xxx
26374,this is just some diapers that are on a rinse cycle I think when they're done when they start spinning I'm gonna jump in the shower
26375,Naima is it getting better or getting worse
26376,you gonna make the train to go around and around on that circle
26377,well I have_to erase some more pictures to make enough room
26378,I'm gonna put the big mixing bowl back down in this cabinet
26379,you don't need to take them all the way off
26380,Pushba where did you go it's time for bed
26381,okay you gonna show it to the bird children
26382,is that what Henry the hippo says to Lars the polar bear
26383,for me to take more pictures so you have_to wait just a minute while I do that
26384,because it takes up so much room it isn't really room to have it here
26385,I wonder if I put all my ribbons and other things in some strange location
26386,so we can go bring her the shoes would you like to help bring her the shoes
26387,you can still sit on the potty even though they're on your ankles
26388,and she is somebody who is a friend of ours
26389,I'm sure they would really enjoy it if you told them what's happening in the pictures
26390,who are you and why are you so white
26391,thank you for cleaning up those blueberries now you can eat them
26392,xxx I'm gonna look in the closet over here
26393,are you gonna tell me if you need a potty Honey
26394,let's sit here and have a conversation before we go to bed
26395,especially if you stood it up this way
26396,what did you say you're doing to the trains
26397,would you wanna put some socks on to keep your feet warm
26398,oh I think some boo+boo cream is what we need to give him
26399,it was making a little noise for a sec
26400,we ate supper with at Sweet Tomatoes a couple of weeks ago
26401,you know we could just eat a slice of pizza at Sweet Tomatoes
26402,the tape was not successful so we're gonna we gonna tape some more now
26403,because it looks like maybe your feet are cold
26404,I'm going to pretend to rub him with this
26405,we could just sit there and eat on the stools if you want or at a table
26406,well it will take quite a while to make more orzo Naima I'm gonna grind the walnuts for you now
26407,it's called lift the lid use the potty
26408,yeah that's where we're gonna do our hiking
26409,that's actually two words pumpkin pies
26410,oh that's Richard scary book we haven't
26411,but let's bring let's bring xxx her shoes first
26412,here is little bunny's brand new purple potty
26413,but there's only one sticker do you see a picture of pumpkin pies
26414,let me see if there's something else I can offer you
26415,yeah we read that the night we came home from our vacation remember
26416,and then we're gonna brush our teeth after that
26417,and I've decided that this is the kind of medicine he needs
26418,the battery situation is that I put new batteries in the transmitters
26419,someone whose name begins with xxx who ate supper with us at Sweet Tomatoes
26420,I don't think you've ever seen pumpkin pie
26421,are you gonna tell him what the words are 'cause I don't think he knows
26422,hey y'know we should do some textures around this place
26423,he needs to have this rubbed gently very very softly on his fur
26424,and there is actually also a new battery in the receiver
26425,who else was there when we had supper at Sweet Tomatoes
26426,it doesn't have a beginning that's right that book doesn't really have a beginning
26427,you would like to hike on your own just walking wouldn't you
26428,I bet some of the leaves and flowers would have good textures
26429,the ones that I got from xxx I can cook them in the microwave
26430,the receiver is what's attached to the camera
26431,and if you wear sneakers then you'll have more traction and you won't slip
26432,well that's alright we're just gonna make a little tag for Grandma that says
26433,today is February third and we're just about one week late in recording
26434,maybe in a little while we could go outside and find things with textures
26435,I think there is something scary in here
26436,it looks like you're getting toasty warm on that heating vent
26437,mhm why don't we sit here together and look at it
26438,I think it's a little girl who's scary
26439,let's see maybe I'll use the pinking shears
26440,I'm worried that you might be a little cold
26441,are you telling her it has animals in it
26442,will you let me know if you need to use the potty
26443,I wanna put all those clothes for our trip to xxx house in the suitcase
26444,it is listen to the jingle isn't it
26445,you looked like you were breathing in the microphone
26446,this is really gotta be thrown away
26447,so who'm I thinking of whose name begins with xxx
26448,now there's room on the table to build a chicken coop
26449,ah I have_to stir around for a little bit then it'll be down in a minute
26450,this is the street hold on let me put this on you
26451,are we gonna use some blocks for that
26452,I think is time to give you some walnuts
26453,oh is that the first time you're having the honey
26454,and I'm gonna give you some more spinach with carrots to have with it
26455,okay I don't want this to be all over the floor so I'm going to take that
26456,oh but it is nice it has a nice flavor
26457,xxx doesn't begin with xxx xxx has an xxx in her name
26458,but for cakes it's actually c not k
26459,where we used to get crystallized honey all the time
26460,here's a valve for one of your sippy cups
26461,I don't know what that's for exactly
26462,Naima I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing I'll be right back
26463,but you're right kuh sometimes is made by letter k
26464,ah this is a street in busy town my what a busy street
26465,you were starting to chip at that and it's gonna get all over the floor if you do that
26466,drinking out of cups that aren't sippy cups
26467,I think he's getting a vaccination with the syringe
26468,okay oh this is the cat family oh I love this one this shows their house
26469,yes those are the buttons that tell you what to do
26470,I don't get to listen to it as much as I like to
26471,well when you're tired it's one thing but because you're old enough you can drink without spilling from a regular cup
26472,oh you did I'm gonna come see that
26473,the one behind you is the one you wrapped
26474,see these stickers we could probably put them where they belong instead
26475,what things about their house that are same as our house
26476,you can't really get it on the Cape
26477,listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar is what he says
26478,she doesn't like having her picture taken
26479,oh you're gonna make an open door for it
26480,I happen to have some right here for bear emergencies
26481,hey and I see the color red which was on that page where the balloon is
26482,we could maybe get a bigger thing or some more
26483,you gonna make me laugh okay I'm ready
26484,so I'm gonna write so that she knows who it's from it's fer
26485,could you let me just put your pj bottoms on please now
26486,well I think you should take him home and put him in bed and let him rest and the boo+boo cream will start working soon
26487,it's gonna be hard for the animals to get in there don't you think
26488,xxx that's before she smells the poopy diaper
26489,oh what a nice picture what kind of a picture is it
26490,I dunno they're just pictures on the tape player
26491,actually I'm gonna write merry Christmas from Naima okay
26492,what do they have that we also have in our house
26493,I think that the Wabash_Cannonball which is the name of the song is also the name of a train
26494,oh it's a nice blue pond isn't it
26495,it might be a little bit spicy why don't you try it
26496,and I'm gonna check this tape and make sure it's recording okay
26497,oh she's probably worried about the baby getting a diaper rash
26498,it's the same kind you had the other day
26499,okay that pause was only about two minutes long
26500,because when you wear a diaper instead of using a potty you can get a diaper rash
26501,it's salty but I think you liked it
26502,and there was something about an ice cream cone
26503,because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another
26504,do you want bread and jam or a couple letter cookies
26505,Naima I'm gonna go over to the washing machine now
26506,you used some hair for bear and the dog and the cat
26507,Jack Sprat could eat no fat his wife could eat no lean
26508,because that way the colors you won't get all xxx all mixed up on the brush
26509,and so between them both you see they lick the platter clean
26510,oh I see there's a lot of hair in that picture
26511,stand up just for a sec while I get this on
26512,now when little bunny has to go it's potty time
26513,yeah trains xxx do usually have names it's true
26514,let's make the fox hide until we finish making the chicken xxx
26515,she pulls down her pants and lifts the lid
26516,oh boy some body's gonna make me laugh
26517,you're right I said the wrong thing didn't I
26518,that's the dope door it's the back door of the kitchen
26519,decide where on the package you wanna put it
26520,she can probably pull down her own big kid pants
26521,he can have his train friend with him can't he
26522,foxes don't like to just stay around people
26523,and there's also some on top so there's some in there
26524,what else do they have in their house that we also have
26525,I'm looking to see if there are any other blue words
26526,you've got a lotta yogurt in there Naima
26527,let's put some pants on and take xxx shoes to her
26528,ah ah someone's gonna make me laugh again
26529,yeah of course not you can take as long as you want
26530,that means it's been cooked in a certain way
26531,don't just eat the yogurt only eat the dal with the rice and the beans too
26532,I don't think Mary's a very funny name
26533,I guess I better get ready to do a lot of laughing
26534,you can let me know if you decide you want another color
26535,and then I'm gonna write in parentheses and also
26536,his friend's not gonna go in that part is there another part that his friend's gonna go in
26537,you know what we could put these other stickers on a plain piece of paper and we could write a story and use the stickers
26538,little bunny sits on the potty and goes
26539,ooh we still have_to pack your socks for the trip I forgot to do that
26540,ah the last part wasn't bad at all
26541,she's looking at some toast flying up into the air out of the toaster
26542,you saw a cumin seed and you ate it
26543,little miss Muffet tuffet eating her curds and whey
26544,I'm gonna put my tape on a different way
26545,there's a drugstore in the mall that we go to sometimes
26546,time to wash and dry those hands while Mommy pours the pee pee in the toilet
26547,along came a spider who sat down beside her and frightened miss Muffet a
26548,we need to get all your dirty clothes from this morning too
26549,I think I hear that the washing machine stopped and that means I need to go and put the laundry that's in the washing machine into the dryer
26550,I don't think anybody is gonna want to eat that
26551,it makes it nice and spicy doesn't it
26552,and then after you're done with brown you can pick out another color
26553,I'm gonna check and make sure this is recording
26554,I bet everyone's smelling the smoke from that toast
26555,d'you wanna help or d'you wanna stay here and play
26556,Arthur and D_W took baby Kate to the street fair
26557,when you burn toast it makes a little smoke sometimes
26558,why don't you break that up with your spoon a little
26559,it's a little song that I'm making up right now and it goes
26560,are you still eating the salmon and the cookies
26561,let me take this Diwali thing out of the way
26562,Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
26563,I think the fox is down there next to that toy basket
26564,there was a flap there it's not there anymore
26565,are you gonna sit and have your cookies
26566,oh are you thinking about Sears where we got our picture taken once
26567,xxx you can let me know when you're done
26568,it's hiding pretty well if you can't see him or her
26569,I wondered if that's what you were thinking about
26570,oh one train did not wanna go that way and switched to go that way instead
26571,do you wanna sippy cup with water in it
26572,because maybe you didn't understand that you shouldn't tear flaps off of flap books
26573,I think I'm gonna take a break from wrapping so that we can all have dinner
26574,well I don't think they live in the water but they might drink from water
26575,well because even when you're a little kid you're still learning how to talk aren't ya
26576,well we went to check and see if they were open yet but there were a lot of people in line
26577,did not wanna go on the circle you mean
26578,xxx Pushpa Pushpa our chickens must be safe I think the fox's coming
26579,do you want to get down play in the living+room or do you want me to give you something fun to do here
26580,you don't really need to put that seat+belt on honey
26581,I don't know there must have been a flap there too
26582,who are Salty's friends this one is Duncan isn't it
26583,you thinking trying to think of other stores in the mall you could open up or go to
26584,do you think that you could go down and tell Daddy that dinner is ready
26585,do you remember when there was stickers on this
26586,orange is the only color you haven't used yet
26587,yes those are rolls that's a kind of bread
26588,let me take this off you while you do that
26589,potty stickers and we could put them there
26590,let's go tell Daddy that dinner is ready and I'll
26591,Sleepy Bear was pretending that was nail polish
26592,so that the colors don't get all mixed up
26593,well I don't want him to get glue on him Naima
26594,see because that potty poster is almost full
26595,if you wanna mix em up you can do that with the brush
26596,oh we were going to look up what a fox sounds like on the computer
26597,he made funny faces but still she cried
26598,but you don't want it to happen accidentally probably
26599,are you talking to the person who's gonna transcribe the tape
26600,it's called uh The Learning Connection or something like that
26601,you can wear your sandals if you want it's not very cold out
26602,we could get a bunch of small stickers that would fit over the numbers
26603,it's the toy store where we got the felt board
26604,with a toddler not a real little tiny baby
26605,you know we have a whole big batch of laundry that has crayon marks on it
26606,you drop them off there and then pick them up and the end of the morning
26607,I don't think I know why he says that
26608,now do you think that fox can get into that chicken coop
26609,he's vacuuming all those little pieces of paper
26610,because these are stickers that don't really belong here
26611,would you like me to stop doing the laundry to play
26612,well I mean one that wouldn't be too big
26613,you were a little tiny baby I'm trying to remember when I bought those did we have those at the old house
26614,what kinds of things do they do at preschool
26615,oh what's he doing is he trying to do a forward row
26616,it's a picture of the Wiggles isn't it
26617,the fox can probably smell the chickens through the walls of the chicken coop
26618,and I bet that fox would prowl around and go around the chicken coop walking around looking for ways to get in
26619,why does the title of the book say Wodney_Wat instead of Rodney_Rat
26620,he doesn't need them does he because he's got fur
26621,I'm gonna give you a different bowl for your berries okay
26622,yes I know I got them at the same time
26623,wouldja like to have some cooked carrots now
26624,how about we could pretend there's a salmon store in the mall
26625,is there something you needed help with or are you okay
26626,and I even I think I know what store I bought them at
26627,and we could even take it with us when we go on our journey and that way you could have potty stickers on your journey
26628,don't you think it can just jump in over those walls
26629,when D_W came out of the store Pal was gone
26630,bear grocery store with just things that bears like
26631,yeah she's using a duster she's standing on a stool
26632,okay let me get some paper towels to help clean you up
26633,these are walnuts with the shells still on them
26634,what probably his parents probably say Rodney rat right
26635,should we take a potty with us on our journey
26636,fox you can stay in the forest and eat wild animals but not our chicks
26637,xxx oh dear oh dear our chicken coop isn't doesn't have a roof
26638,I'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into
26639,I'm gonna give you the purple glue stick
26640,so you drop them off at the school and they play with the doll there
26641,mm lift it up and put it in the garbage
26642,well they aren't toddlers they probably can pronounce their r
26643,or you could actually put them into the ice+cube tray
26644,so you were a toddler when I got them
26645,oh no cried Arthur why would Pal run away
26646,no this one is the one I'm going to give you today
26647,maybe because she's too short and he's tall enough to reach
26648,sometimes what a fox will do is carry an egg or maybe even a chick or a chicken off
26649,is great to go to a preschool where you have some friends
26650,it's just that when you're little and growing up some things are hard to pronounce
26651,you yelled at him today for chewing your slippers
26652,which potty do you think we should take with us on the journey should we take this potty seat and leave these two at home
26653,hey did you put that dress on the daddy
26654,it won't actually stay to eat it there I don't think
26655,what was that other kind in in addition to hazel nuts that you just mentioned
26656,and that's part of what preschool is all about playing with your friends
26657,it's hard to twist your mouth in that just the right way
26658,because it wants to run away and make sure the people don't catch it so it will carry away a chick or an egg
26659,where is my chick cock_a_doodle_doo where is my chick
26660,oh the shorts are a little bit hard to get on aren't they
26661,that bunny rabbit is erasing the letter c on the chalk board
26662,do you think it's hard to say some words
26663,but I don't actually know what it's supposed to mean
26664,then Arthur said D_W take Kate home maybe she needs a doctor
26665,oh but some of it will come off in the bath
26666,would you like me to make some eggs out of bees wax
26667,what words do you think it's hard to say
26668,that's how it is with old song and old poems
26669,I don't know may be she wants to spell some other things
26670,let's see let me get this laundry going
26671,and I need to find Pal he began calling
26672,I think we have a muffin tin that has twelve
26673,sometimes you don't always know exactly what they're talking about
26674,oh no farmers don't let foxes take so many chicks away
26675,okay you wanna stand at the door while I go out to the car and get it
26676,I'm gonna give you this big muffin tin
26677,oh there now the daddy's legs aren't cold anymore
26678,Arthur passed the ring toss table the bob for apples table and a table with pumpkin pies chocolate cakes and cookies
26679,xxx am I cooking nursies over a fire
26680,that's the kind of thing we can look up and find out
26681,yup the paint gets into the water and colors the water red
26682,some people like some foods and other people don't
26683,I hope you're going to say something after I bring it in
26684,she wants to erases what he's writing
26685,you may live near our farm but you may not take all our chicks
26686,would you like to try using spoon for those
26687,here I'm 'unna help you turn on the dryer
26688,he wished there was a table with hamburgers
26689,it doesn't have_to do with whether you're grown+up or not really
26690,oh a little bit of dried yogurt's on your hand
26691,that's the same name as the little girl you played with
26692,Pal would be sure to be hanging around it
26693,I know it's kinda hard to reach isn't it
26694,just has to do with people people liking different things
26695,okay I think you're ready to wipe aren't you
26696,have you seen a lost puppy Arthur asked the police officer
26697,uh I think a trip to the bathroom sink would be good
26698,but while we're not pretending Greenboro right now we can borrow it can't we
26699,I'll wait and see if you say it when I come inside
26700,this isn't like the sponges where you make them all go in the same
26701,I think our car is yeah our car's on this side
26702,what do we have that we could make a fox den out of
26703,there's little hairs in most people's noses
26704,you know if your tummy ever hurts like that again
26705,well I'm protecting all of my animals here
26706,it's a little early I thought I would wait
26707,yeah that's what's happening the water is splashing and spraying all over the place
26708,so should we get out the shopping cart and set up a store
26709,oh thank you said Arthur and he ran to the school
26710,I thought I'd wait til you were home but if you're not gonna be home til late then I should do it without you
26711,I think the bears came to Betsy Allen's house because they could smell blueberries
26712,a den might be in the root of an old tree or
26713,and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat
26714,xxx hm there is some things there are some things Daddy likes that I don't like
26715,can we take some of the animals out to make special stalls for the sick animals
26716,then you'll know that maybe it's time to use the potty
26717,I'll find you some mail you can open in a little bit
26718,I bet that rabbit turned on the water too high so there's too much water coming out
26719,I don't know why cause I don't know about this song
26720,she had so many blueberries in her house they couldn't help but smell them
26721,back at the street fair the clown with the balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
26722,Daddy likes whole wheat halwa and I don't like that very much
26723,you came to me and you said my tummy is hurting
26724,well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat
26725,because when Grandma xxx got you these last year for Christmas she got you two different sets of dolls
26726,let's take them out so that there's room for the
26727,and I said sometimes that means you need to use the potty
26728,that bear no ah that I mean that book is called something else let me try to think of what
26729,and as he fell he let go of his balloons
26730,I like most things Daddy likes actually I think
26731,I think this is itchy isn't it
26732,and some of the dolls were the same and had the same clothes even
26733,looks like she has a little container for paint brushes maybe she's doing water colors
26734,which means it's really ten past five in the old time
26735,you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put this down here
26736,it sounds like it's maybe a song about dancing cause it's about hopping
26737,a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings with his teeth
26738,because your nose is actually connected to your throat
26739,actually I don't really remember what that book is called
26740,alright I'll get it sometime in the next half hour and I'll page you or
26741,I was wondering if you were a little bit cold there
26742,what a good idea we can hide them from the fox
26743,so that's not gonna be a cause of itchy
26744,and then you can pick things off the shelves of the aisle
26745,yes I do remember that one that's a different one
26746,I like to eat nuts but I don't like them as much as Daddy does
26747,but we also got that one out the library in xxx Maine I think that's why you're thinking of them together they both are at same library
26748,and I need to find my keys cause I might've locked the car
26749,so is the daddy gonna stroll that baby
26750,Ally's look like she's got some nice water toys in there that big bucket
26751,why don't you take the animals out and we'll have a veterinary hospital in the barn
26752,let's see lemme go find my coat cause my keys might be in my coat
26753,oh here's the alphabet you know all these letters
26754,oh the fox is eating the weasel my my
26755,and then I'll go out and get the sticker book
26756,how about if we turn the doll cradle that's up there on the table upside down
26757,well no I was gonna do it now actually
26758,now that you can put things on by yourself
26759,oh is it grizzly bear there that didn't have buttons
26760,and now I would like to go eat my supper so I'd like you to wipe
26761,you made one for me already or you're xxx you're still making it
26762,I don't think they're gonna smell too much
26763,are the bird children gonna walk on the bridge
26764,you mean like a i_v fluid is what you mean
26765,I'll get it I'll get it I'll get it
26766,that pig is painting the other pig's head by accident
26767,I don't need nursie milk because I'm a grown+up
26768,then suddenly bang pop bang the balloons hit a tall tree
26769,and then I'll help you because you pooped so I need to help you wipe your bottom
26770,or do you need to make a bridge over that river
26771,sometimes home is just like gym class except we don't have all the same equipment
26772,well I don't know I would say sour is the opposite of sweet
26773,oh you want me come in and you're the person behind the counter
26774,the hand towels are really just for hands actually
26775,child is painting on the floor and then there's a bird
26776,you don't you don't have any bottom's on
26777,I can't dance in the livingroom with you when I'm cooking
26778,I'm making more room on the floor and taking down the trains
26779,yeah I gave you a different brush because the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper
26780,where did the fox is the fox sleeping in its den
26781,and some funny orange shapes and some stickers
26782,that might be a good fox den if it's hidden
26783,when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
26784,those are wait those animals school children animals are waiting for school bus to pick them up
26785,okay I'm going to the car even though it's gonna be so cold
26786,camouflaged in the woods let's make the forest down here
26787,it might be hard to get that out actually
26788,does the bear want more of the plain kind of yogurt
26789,Mommy's gonna be really really cold
26790,you still gonna glue some things on it
26791,yes street cleaners they're sweeping up aren't they
26792,well I don't think salty is the opposite of sweet
26793,hm Mommy is very sleepy can you put me to bed
26794,that chick belongs in the farm with its mother the hen
26795,I want you to just definitely stay right in the house okay
26796,but I don't I never carried you in the basket into the store like that
26797,because you can have something that's not salty that's unsalted but it's not necessarily sweet
26798,I think we need something to take it out like a chopstick or something very narrow that could poke it out
